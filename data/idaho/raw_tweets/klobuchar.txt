klobuchar was so irrelevant we didn’t even discuss her in the group chat.
@amyklobuchar KLOBUCHAR SURGINGGGF.
Tonight’s tweets will be sponsored by miller lite and tearing apart an Amy klobuchar speech for an English paper.
It’s interesting that @ewarren is described as filleting Bloomberg or even ripping his stents out & @amyklobuchar is seen as so hate driven she’ll bomb Southbend There’s an underlying stereotype of the evil blood-thirsty witch as opposed to a strong woman #DemocratDebate.
Warren is a wealth of talent- she would be masterful in dealing with foreign powers Because words matter see how she picked apart the "apology"? always in control of her emotions , unlike @amyklobucharhttps://twittercom/girlsreallyrule/status/1230463753126281216 ….

Amy Klobuchar may not be blatantly homophobic, but she definitely feels superior to gays https://wwwlgbtqnationcom/2020/02/amy-klobuchar-may-not-blatantly-homophobic-definitely-feels-superior-gays/#Xk8c6a1Si74twitter …   What are ya thoughts on this ?

@JoeBiden @MikeBloomberg @ewarren @PeteButtigieg @amyklobuchar   STOP ATTACKING ANYONE ON THE DEBATE STAGE EXCEPT BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP! YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET BERNIE OUT OF FIRST PLACE!.
@amyklobuchar  I have supported you from the beginning with monthly donations I hate to say it, but I agree with @BluePrinceton  You are at the point of enabling Bernie We can’t win with him Encourage your supporters to move to Biden or Buttigieg Time is of the essence https://twittercom/BluePrinceton/status/1232077588513906688 ….

Bernie turning on the Ds who allowed him 2 run as a democrat Now he’s “taking on the “political establishment” who forced @amyklobuchar & @PeteButtigieg out of the race” No Bernie, #Amy & #Pete didn’t have a way 4ward, as realists they pulled out 2beat Don What r u gonna do?.

I love when they say Bernie Sanders comes across as "mean"  @JoeBiden comes across as demented  @ewarren comes across as a lying   @PeteButtigieg comes across as a Republican  @MikeBloomberg comes across as an oligarch  And @amyklobuchar comes across as irrelevant.
Warren Hands down, no doubt After her it's klobuchar.
The speed with which centrist liberals switched from buttigieg to klobuchar to Warren to Bloomberg via contested convention to sheer grief that Sanders is going to win in just this week?  Poetic cinema.
i just walked past a fucking amy klobuchar campaign office without realizing it was there beforehand it was a completely empty rented space with 2 white women and like 50 amy klobuchar signs plastering the walls.
Not all of the candidates are strong on climate and some are downright AWFUL (klobuchar) Greenpeace gives Bernie an A+ and there’s this https://centeractionfundorg/environmental-report-card/ ….
@cspanwj I think people are wasting their votes on butttigieg, warren & klobuchar  There is no way any one of them will win the presidential election  I as an ind would not take a chance on any of them  it's a hard choice, but if it's between them & trump, I just can't do it.
@PeteButtigieg and @amyklobuchar need to drop out! They won't fare well in upcoming states! We must not let Bernie win! Same w/Bloomberg and Biden will SURGE!! https://twittercom/NYAnna22/status/1231345683288018945 ….
Hey @SteveKornacki @andersoncooper tell the Dems! More people voting for anyone BUT Sanders in your primary! @amyklobuchar out @PeteButtigieg  out @SenWarren  out @TomSteyer out @TulsiGabbard  is a Russian buddy out or Trump wins @maddow @CNNSotu @MSNBC tell them PLEASE !!!.
Sanders will get none of his program enacted As @amyklobuchar has said, he doesn't have 2/3 of Dem Senators supporting his plan.
Lmao @washingtonpost lists one of Bernie’s least supportive group as “prefer candidate who can beat Donald trump” where he gets 23% of the vote They list that same group as one of the “best” for klobuchar; where she has 14% if the vote Tell me more about electability wapo pictwittercom/4xgiYWxo0P.
No idea what’ll happen during the remainder of this crazy primary, but @MommieRuthless and I just #voted!  #yesonm #yesonprop13 #katieporterforcongress @amyklobuchar @elizabethwarrenpictwittercom/DlsZXru0G7.
I support @amyklobuchar for President  I could also support @ewarren or @PeteButtigieg or @JoeBiden or even @MikeBloomberg   #Steyer & #Gabbard have no chance & should drop out before the #SCprimary.
I would love to see Biden team with @amyklobuchar or @KamalaHarris I think he definitely needs to have a strong VP that can take the ropes when needed.
I'm going to vote for @amyklobuchar in the wisconsin primary.
can't believe klobuchar is willing to hire such blatantly toxic and misogynistic bros.
please stop smearing masochists by associating us with amy klobuchar fans this is not and never will be true i never even considered supporting her this is akin to libel and i would tolerate it.

as umru perfectly said: "its such a privilege to put anything else above the lives of real ppl" this isn't someone going through a hard breakup who needs time to breathe, this is a 70 year old adult senator klobuchar endorsed biden at the same rally that she quit the race.
Amy Klobuchar @amyklobuchar would make an excellent ATTORNEY GENERAL  She knows the law and she has a firm grip on reality.
the editorial board? klobuchar and warren we’ve known newspaper endorsements aren’t effective.

I can't put into words how offended I am that @PeteButtigieg @amyklobuchar and the @DNC  decided they wanted Joe Biden, who has had gaffe after gaffe, to be their candidate to ride behind It's insulting and we deserve 4 more years of Trump if Biden is the nominee.
I could fo for that  Or   Biden/Clinton Biden/Klobuchar Biden/Harris   @HillaryClinton @amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris.
i understand the sentiment, but alienating a group of people (warren supporters) will not bode well for sanders if warren ends up dropping out of the race with buttigieg and klobuchar dropping out, the split in the progressives is already a disadvantage.
