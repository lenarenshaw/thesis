yeah the ying yang twins.
that’s also untrue we exclude no one we’d love your vote, we’d love to get you and everyone you know healthcare, and we’d love to keep hearing from you about ways to make life better for everyone we know yang supporters mean well.
yang’s plan says nothing about rent control, or really regulation of any kind it’s techno-libertarianism.
the bottom line is if yang supporters want to continue the ubi conversation, it’s going to be heard most under a sanders administration no other candidate would even entertain the idea a lot of bernie supporters believe in ubi, just not yang’s version of it.
we welcome yang gang with open arms come join the winning team.
the whisper song by ying yang twins will never NOT slap y’all.
yang should’ve endorsed someone he left thousands and thousands of devoted supporters with nowhere to turn .
Is Amy Klobuchar actually #yanggang?.
