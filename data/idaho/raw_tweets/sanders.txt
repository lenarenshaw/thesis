Perhaps sanders should do as you say, not as he does? Because the finger pointing is off putting when it starts with the candidate.
in primary elections, you should attempt to delineate candidates and sanders supporters believe him to be more progressive however, warren isn’t running and since she ran on a progressive platform she should endorse sanders.

Do you support our future president bernie sanders.
You shouldn't be celebrating You said it right, you'd be much better off running against Bloomberg if the "left of center" establishment and media can keep him in protective bubble, keep Biden viable as well, deny sanders a majority, and implode the party at the convention.
if i were running the simulation i'd pick sanders, just to mix it up.
The media is openly biased against him, and hillary clinton is a dirty campaigner (fueling the obama birther conspiracy) To say sanders hasnt been vetted is laughable.

A sanders presidency?    The only scared people are liberal pundits who’ll have to write articles from now till Sanders looses in November defending and promoting socialism  Have fun, @JRubinBlogger!.
yup The other candidates should have been surveying folks and asking WHY these people are liking Sanders and then using it to appeal the same way because if sanders gets the nom, understand that this is bc people voted for him for all intents and purpose it will be on us.
I have go agree If send go the sanders route, I'll get over the butt hurt and vote bernie The alternative is not acceptable at all.

one good thing about caucuses (that would be better shown in ranked choice) is that you get a much better feeling for how the electorate understands the 'sameness' of different candidates, especially with so many running  going to see a huge flow of warren to sanders support.
Reassure them that sanders has promised a retraining program so they can learn to be welders or pipefitters or something else that is actually useful.
