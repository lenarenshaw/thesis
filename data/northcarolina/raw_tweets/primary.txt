Well, look at this @GithiomiN @mutethiajeffrey   But I will admit that I got the order of the primary wrong   The Nevada caucus is on the week before the South Carolina primary https://twittercom/KinuthiaMorgan/status/1201564086963716098 ….
Hillary boosted Trump and then lost to him so your article about South Carolina being an open primary state doesn't do much for your argument, Pam .

You can’t embarrassingly lose the first 3 primary states & still claim you’re the most electable candidate No shot at South Carolina after going 0/3 Time for @JoeBiden to drop out.
Need to check those sudden democrat registrations Could be republicans voting for Sanders They are doing that in open primary states like South Carolina.
The reality is that in the modern system the candidate who looks to be winning after Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina wins Every time (Except in the Democratic primary of 1992) There’s a bandwagon effect Voters like winners https://thebulwarkcom/the-5-lessons-from-2016-democrats-need-to-understand-if-they-want-to-stop-bernie/ … via @BulwarkOnline.
It is becoming more obvious that the order of the states in the primary creates part of the problem  If South Carolina had been first, before Iowa, or Wisconsin or Michigan were first, then the whole dynamic would be different.

Watch live: South Carolina Democratic primary https://youtube/zAV2RWMxgeU  via @YouTube.
Any South Carolina voter who’s votes for Tom Steyer is a complete fool #SCprimary2020 #TrumpLandslideVictory2020.
MSM seems preoccupied with race in the South Carolina primary Didn’t hear that much about race before or after the New Hampshire primary Maybe it says something about which candidate they favor.
South Carolina primary polls close in 1 minute.
Interesting moment today:  A Japanese news crew was on campus today, and they interviewed a few of my students about the Democratic primary in South Carolina   Go figure, lol.
People across the state are voting early in North Carolina's primary election!  You can look up your voter record and see your sample ballot here: http://wwwmyncvotecom pictwittercom/i4FgEpbUWT.
Chatham County, North Carolina Early primary voting location in a minority-majority district This is for a Democractic Primary, not Republican, which, obviously, means people brought in 1) several dozen confederate flags, 2) their own flag poles mounted to trucks, @maddow @CNNpictwittercom/TlNKAAzMPN.

I’m hoping to take another Bernie Journey! This time to South Carolina right before the primary.
Which is why I also can't say I'm willing to ask African-Americans to go to the back of the bus, and my vote on Super Tuesday will largely depend upon the results of the South Carolina primary  2/2.

Biden is heading to South Carolina as we speak to make sure Pete doesn’t get a single black vote in that primary He’s campaigning for Bernie, basically.
"Joe Biden cancels his primary party in New Hampshire and heads to South Carolina early"   To be fair, I think Bernie Sanders canceled his party.

Imagine what this race might look like if Nevada and South Carolina led the primary season instead of Iowa and New Hampshire Of course, that’s also why it’s unlikely to change.
South Carolina is a red state It’ll be red in November The Democrat primary voting makes up a tiny fraction of General Election voters The majority of SC Dem primary voters are black and are guided by a longtime Dem state level machine in SC In other words, they do what.
