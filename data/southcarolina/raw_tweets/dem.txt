I assume South Carolina voters who care about gun rights don’t vote in the democratic primary, but Biden needs to boost african American turnout  Alluding to Dylan Roof killing a politician might work.
And they think Trump won’t play that video of Biden saying people in Florida, North Carolina and Penn won’t vote for democratic socialist? They don’t want us to say anything negative because it will be used in the general but it’s okay for them to fear monger against Bernie .

What I'm hoping for here is that if Joe Biden gets rained on in New Hampshire then that doesn't snowball into Nevada and (especially) South Carolina  States like Iowa and New Hampshire are a lot whiter than the *average* democratic primary voter.

3) His appeal is almost exclusively to white people over 40, a demographic that is overrepresented in Iowa and New Hampshire Even if Biden's attacks don't end Pete in New Hampshire, they will stop Pete's momentum in Nevada, South Carolina, and on Super Tuesday.
REASONS I WILL NOT VOTE FOR BERNIE IN THE PRIMARY #2b Because the Republicans want me to  The GOP plan to cross party lines and vote for Bernie in the So Carolina primary because they believe he presents the weakest general election threat to Trump https://wwwpostandcouriercom/politics/upstate-gop-leaders-plotting-to-impact-sc-democratic-primary-by/article_f1e7abd2-4788-11ea-aa9f-33a1d262994chtml ….

About the same as Iowa The states do not represent the Democrat party demographic at all South Carolina is much closer That, to me, will be a much more interesting primary result.
Here’s the thing-Lots of great candidates to split vote and push Bernie w/ GOP backing him:”Although the South Carolina GOP had canceled its own primary, Leupp said the move to support Sanders “can still help Trump win” https://wwwnationalreviewcom/news/south-carolina-gop-plans-to-boost-sanders-to-influence-dem-primary/amp/ ….
Focus should be on South Carolina & Republican Party is doing to America’s democracyCancel Republican presidential primary when there are other candidates in the party  State have open primaries with GOP canceled telling the state registered (R) stuff the ballot.
There is a reason the GOP in South Carolina is urging republicans to vote for sanders in the open primary and it’s not bc they like him https://wwwpostandcouriercom/politics/upstate-gop-leaders-plotting-to-impact-sc-democratic-primary-by/article_f1e7abd2-4788-11ea-aa9f-33a1d262994chtml … .
Also, South Carolina is not even having a republican primary, so republicans have nothing to lose by voting in the democratic primary.
9 districts: 2 Dem  2 senators: 0 dem   Seems unlikely? Plus He’s obviously appealing to a large base as he has about 20-24% support     It could definitely go much lower once we get to states such as South Carolina but so far he’s run a good campaign that’s challenges others.
Bloomberg who campaigned for Bush yet Sanders is a no because he isn't a democrat Biden will come 4th again in NH  Maybe 5th will also lose Nevada After 3 losses will also be 2nd to Sanders in South Carolina.

If you find anything please let me know! I haven't found diddly yet, and meanwhile Trump is praising Bernie left and right and saying he should be nominee and GOP is openly encouraging it's South Carolina voters to jack the dem primary in favor of Bernie  We have to ask why.
No I’m talking to my democrat friends in my state who are on the ground  Sanders is at 15% here South Carolina and states like Pa are rich in delegates.

New Hampshire Primary prediction: Sanders wins He will then go on to win Nevada and South Carolina as well Why? Biden was crushed due to the impeachment process Main stream democrats as well Buttigieg is too close to Corporate America and will not have black support.
If Biden had finished a close 2nd in Iowa like polling suggested he'd be in much better shape But a distant 4th is brutal for him and really demonstrates the softness of his support  If Buttigieg disintigrates in Nevada and South Carolina the support could flow back to Biden.
The democratic primary in South Carolina does not reflect the demographics of the country.

Great show @TheRevAl thanks for pointing out the skip over South Carolina from the dem candidates.
LOL No  Biden winning south carolina by 5 points will not change the early voting that is happening in CA and around the country right now  Remember when you said that Bernie wasn't hitting his demographic targets in 2016?  Biden needs to win SC big to comeback.

Right! tRump wants Sanders, knowing his "democratic socialist" is a no win for the Democrats tRump has eased up on Biden, but watch for it as Biden did very well last night and South Carolina will put him in the lead.
two new polls out of South Carolina from yesterday // https://realclearpoliticscom/epolls/latest_polls/state_democratic_nomination_polls/ …  UMass: Biden 23 Sanders 21 Steyer 13 Buttigieg 11 Warren 11 Klobuchar 9  Change Research: Biden 23 Sanders 23 Steyer 20 Buttigieg 15 Warren 9 Klobuchar 8  #Bernie2020 #OnlyBernie.
@jonfavs instead of Iowa going first next time, they could have Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, & Nevada all go first on the same day  If we did this it would give a great representation of all demographics & Biden would be in a much stronger position right now.
Sanders, the favorite in Nevada [] is threatening an upset of Biden in South Carolina and has the potential to pick up roughly half of the delegates on Super Tuesday, building what could become an insurmountable delegate lead  https://theinterceptcom/2020/02/20/elizabeth-warren-mike-bloomberg-nevada-democratic-debate/ ….

Yes Bloomberg is a really good foil for her and I would think would allow her to drain some of Bernie’s left support that he gained after Iowa and NH But given demographics and early voting in Nevada ( and then South Carolina), not clear how much https://twittercom/NateSilver538/status/1230358996776898560 ….
During the democrat debate last night, the democrats said 28 times “defeat Donald Trump”  That means every 4 minutes and 11 seconds they said “defeat Donald Trump”  That kinda rhetoric does not appeal to voters in North Carolina ohio and Wisconsin States that thrive under trump.
Excited for the Nevada caucus and South Carolina primary results to come in just so I can watch all the people on here who for the last 35 years have been throwing shit fits about “democracy dying” start a new tantrum about how The People (voters) can’t be trusted.
The next debate has high requirements:  One delegates from Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada  At least 10% in four DNC-approved polls or 12% from two in South Carolina   It will be hosted by @CBS and the Congressional Black Caucus  #DemocraticDebatehttps://wwwwashingtonpostcom/politics/2019/11/11/everything-you-need-know-about-next-democratic-debate/?arc404=true ….

E galopando pra chegar firme e forte na Carolina do Sul, um cenário onde até os democratas estão, em geral, à direita  Na pior das hipóteses, ele fica no top 2 (mas há chance de ATÉ MESMO GANHAR) e tá ameaçando o Joe Biden que tinha uma liderança sólida lá antes das primárias.
Bernie may have a lead at present, but it is far from "commanding" Let's see how he does in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday  I want to see the traditional Dem base in action: Women/POC I also discount caucuses as being pretty undemocratic by design Primaries matter more.

Tiene pinta que Sanders se lleva Carolina del Sur Pero sigue siendo interesante ver quién va quedando segundo en delegados, aunque no parece que ninguno de los demás vaya a lograr despuntar.

I try not to be rude to ordinary voters But I have no sympathy for the candidates themselves If Biden loses Nevada, a state he is supposed to do better in due to favorable demographics, there is no way he can beat  Trump South Carolina is irrelevant in a general election.
In both democratic primary contests so far exit polls have shown ~60% of voters have supported Medicare for all that eliminates private healthcare Pete is taking a gamble that those results won’t be replicated in South Carolina.

It just seems like South Carolina and Florida have been polled a lot lately and demographically they’re probably two of theworst states for Bernie But on the bright side we’re seeing good numbers in big, non-Southern states like the Wisconsin poll today.

He will, North Carolina has gotten pretty Blue since 2016, A Democrat actually won govenorship that year lol!  In young states turning more Blue like North Carolina, Virginia he'll win  In Colorado, California and Texas he should run up the score thanks to the demographics.

I mean my ideal is a national primary, but if not I would generally do a 4-5 state primary spread across multiple Geo locations So for example a Washington, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina primary would give a much clearer look at the actual populations and demographics.

I don’t really understand why people refer to South Carolina as Biden’s firewall  It’s one state that is no more or less important than any other And it’s also a state that democrats will lose in November.

South Carolina Republicans aren’t even having their own presidential primary this year That’s by design- a state with an open primary  https://wwwcnncom/2020/02/13/politics/south-carolina-democratic-primary-gop-movement/indexhtml ….
The issue is Sanders, and his message, unlikely to beat trump in PA, OH, Michigan, N Carolina,  other battleground states -  where a mod dem has better chance   Even overwintering wins in NY, Cal others - may drive a popular vote win - and another election loss.
Nevada's democratic electorate was 63,4% white in 2016 according to 538 South Carolina is one of the few states were the Dem electorate isn't majority white, and I doubt that Buttigieg will do well there But he could come in second in Nevada even with almost no minority support.

Ms Warren I am all set to vote for you, but I am concerned that we are the party of govt give away When most democrats talk about govt “give always” its a very red flag for the moderates and those “never trumpers”  Common sense tells us increasing minimum wage wd go further.

Huh? I'm a progressive dem Have you seen the news? Yang gang has been called a cult by many people and there's pics posted by others literally drinking the koolaid Ya'll are the ones saying you're going to write him in in Nov instead of vote for some1 running.
He said he was endorsing the dem nominee Did you not know? Why are you being so rude? And a vote for someone not running does go towards someone else bc it takes away from whoever loses and could have been beaten This is exactly how this works.
Voting for Yang is voting for one of those people anywayyou're not getting something you want by writing him in There's no single benefit and he's endorsing the dem nominee He literally doesn't want people doing this.
