My predictions for Iowa  1 Sanders 2 Buttigieg  3 Biden 4 Warren 5 Klobuchar 6 Yang  All the rest under 1% I think Biden loses Iowa and New Hampshire, and then dominates South Carolina Pete/Sanders/Warren are just awful with most non-white demographics.
“Nobody likes Bernie” as Bernie wins Iowa and New Hampshire Look, he’s my favorite for the nomination But any dem, Even Bloomberg, is 100000 times better than trump So if he doesn’t win it I’ll be a good boy and back the nominee as Bernie wants us to.

Dan, that was what the impeachment was all about Tie Bernie, Elizabeth & Amy to DC Senate trial so they could not campaign so Biden could soak up all the dem sunshine at Iowa, New Hampshire etc.

1/ Your facts are simply incorrect there was nothing "landslide" about the DNC vote or the POTUS vote, unless you want to dig into specific demographics Example from: https://wwwhuffpostcom/entry/how-super-delegates-decid_b_10098414 …  "At the polls [Sanders] won New Hampshire's pledged delegates by a landslide 22%.
Iowa and New Hampshire Dem primaries are also overwhelmingly white, and Bernie is winning the polls in both states    I always say that Iowa and NH should not be our first two states They do not represent Democrats demographically.
Biden once daydreamed about beating up Trump but Biden hasn’t gone after his primary opponents   With Sanders surging in Iowa and New Hampshire and California, how much longer can that last?    https://wwwrealclearpoliticscom/articles/2020/02/01/biden_the_brawler__bring_him_on_some_dems_urge_142290html … via @RealClearNews.
Biden is in the lead in national polling average, but not in Iowa or New Hampshire More importantly, since polls are easily manipulable, Bernie's in the lead in betting averages, which is a more objective indicator https://wwwrealclearpoliticscom/elections/betting_odds/democratic_2020_nomination/ ….

Iowa and New Hampshire are demographically quite different from some of the later primary states.

"There is no donor requirement, but candidates can also qualify by earning at least one delegate in the Iowa caucuses on Feb 3 or in the New Hampshire primary on Feb 11"  This requirement should get Pete onto the next debate stage in Nevada https://wwwnytimescom/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineuphtml ….

Bernie is leading polls not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire Only 4 dem candidates won the first 2 states on a row, all of them winning not only the nominee, but also general election It's time to beat Trump, say goodbye to the 1%.
Yet he’s leading in polls nationally and in Iowa, New Hampshire, California, Washington, Nevada All those democratic primary voters duped to vote for an independent who’s fighting for policies they need What a rip off am I right?.

If Mike Bloomberg must take the debate stage then I want the first question to be :   "Mr Bloomberg, why are you skipping the first vital primary states?  Why are you depriving the people of Iowa and New Hampshire their say on you? Why are you dishonouring American democracy?".

Iowa ond New Hampshire are caucus states, a vicious holdover from undemocratic times Look to the primary states for what Democrats want.
If he outperforms expections and secures delegates in Iowa that can propel him to do well in New Hampshire He has a lot of support from non dems that may not be showing up in polls If people turn out to caucus for him we could see serious momentum for the rest of the race.
Het zou nog wel eens cruciaal kunnen zijn wie wanneer uit stapt Ben benieuwd in hoeverre het veld zich uitdunt na New Hampshire of pas later Vraag me af of Warren bijv in de race blijft als ze 3e/4e wordt in Iowa & New Hampshire Idem Buttigieg.
Bernie Sanders ganhará Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, California e Texas Muito provavelmente será o nomeado democrata Amém .
The 2020 dem primary is starting to look a lot like 2016 Just biden vs Sanders instead of Clinton vs Sanders Close tie in iowa, sanders wins new Hampshire, biden wins big in South Carolina etc We may have a 2 way race pretty quick.
Bloomberg steht weder in Iowa noch in New Hampshire, Nevada oder South Carolina auf dem Wahlzettel Bloomberg nimmt erst ab dem Super Tuesday am 03 März an den Vorwahlen teil.
Egal, dann wäre es die Vorschau auf New Hampshire, da wird wohl doch auf dem Wahlzettel stehen? :).

Alan the reason the House dems rushed the impeachment thru & then sat on it for a month was timing for the Democratic primaries in Iowa & New Hampshire; To keep Senate dem candidates hands tied up in the Senate w/impeachment so they could not campaign DNC already choose Biden.

If the Impeachment Trial drags on past Iowa and New Hampshire, Bernie will be effectively hobbled as a campaigner That's the biggest obstacle, at this point  As far as Bloomberg is concerned, I see his polling share eating more into Biden's demographics, minus the Deep South.
Sanders will win Iowa and New Hampshire The establishment dems and MSM will lose their minds trying to thwart his campaign Perhaps even throwing their support behind Bloomberg to preserve their corporate interests Against all the DNC’s efforts I see Bernie winning the nom.

Bernie becomes the first dem candidate to win Iowa and New Hampshire then lose the nomination.
Coincido contigo con Buttigieg Se tendrá que ver Bloomberg no participa en los procesos de febrero (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada y Missouri) pero con su cartera puede ser capaz de avanzar a partir de marzo Biden está fuerte entre los demócratas conservadores del sur.
This is week is our final push for all of our hard work over the last 3 years to elect Bernie Sanders as the democratic nominee Keep an eye on Iowa & New Hampshire, if he wins them, it will help us on Super Tuesday Though the numbers look good for him, this war isn’t over.

Keep in mind in early primaries:    Iowa:   906% WHITE  New Hampshire:  932% WHITE   We won't even reach a state that resembles the real Dem party demographics until we get to South Carolina   Don't despair   No one can/will win this race w/o support of the Black community.

There's a small but nontrivial chance Sanders wins Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada by big margins and the dem establishment is all "Oh wow" and just kind of rolls over for him once he's proven his electability cred, kinda like how black voters went 0-60 on Obama after he won Iowa.

Yea the party is mainly behind Biden at the moment as his policies align better with the corporate democrats in charge Only the progressive dems like AOC, Omar, Etc are behind Bernie He’s currently leading in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, so I’m hoping they realize the.
This is great news Now the trial can drag on for a few more weeks making sure that Sanders, Warren & Kolbuchar miss Iowa and New Hampshire That ought to throw a wrench into the democrats primary hopes.

I don’t trust the democrat establishment, I think they are going to somehow find a way to fuck Bernie out of winning Iowa or New Hampshire If he wins the two it is going to be incredibly hard to stop him.

@TomPerez should resign as DNC chair 1) Changing the rules to allow Bloomberg to buy his way into the primary is undemocratic 2) The negligent and slow rollout of inaccurate Iowa numbers gives Buttigieg an unfair media boost going into New Hampshire #IowaCaucusResults #Rigged.

Curious what the path is for Elizabeth Warren is given that she was 3rd in Iowa, looks like 3rd/4th in next door New Hampshire, and these states should be demographically stronger for her than the country as a whole The model gives her more of a chance than a top 2 finisher?.
I bet the last 4% of the iowa vote will put sanders in first place and it turns out this whole thing was a ploy to get media attention on buttigieg before the new hampshire vote in a week Anything to keep the soc-dem from winning.
@TomPerez As a new citizen and a caribbean black woman I dare say the democrats know how to loose  As a Biden supporter , Trump is getting exactly what he wants ,not to face Mr Biden Iwoans and New Hampshire democrats are doing his bidding.

Je suis mort Tom Perez a demandé de recompter les voix dans l’Iowa ?!? Pas sûr que Buttigieg ait gagné du coup On aura les résultats finaux et officiels après le New Hampshire For sure.
But Mr Sanders, speaking at his New Hampshire campaign headquarters, cited his lead in other, raw numbers that are effectively an expression of the popular vote in Iowa“Even  #2016 #an #Buttigieg #campaign #Caucus #DemocraticParty #election #England #enhttps://wwwenmnewscom/2020/02/06/iowa-democratic-party-says-it-will-conduct-a-recanvass-if-a-campaign-requests-it/ ….
@HouseDemocrats @dscc If democrats want to win in 2020, we must be truthful The political landscape doesn't favor the candidates running in Iowa & New Hampshire Defeating Trump isn't going to be a walk in the park Conclusion: Only Mike Bloomberg can beat Trump like a drum.

Tom Perez announces a demand to stop voting and recount now! Just moments before the final satellite caucus counts (which are going to Sanders by 70+ percent) are released The recount will probably take exactly as long as it takes for the polls in New Hampshire to close.
Cool Bernie's going to win New Hampshire He's going to win the nomination There is no situation with Warren He's a progressive democratic socialist and she's not She's walked back a lot of her progressive policies and what do ya know, she's been on a slide.
And after allowing Buttigieg to appear as the leader days, all this does is extend his time in the media spotlight and give less runway for Bernie to celebrate his results and use them to motivate going into New Hampshire/Nevada They're trying to demoralize us, don't let it work.

Why is Iowa such a big deal for Dems?  Their demographics aren't represented in Iowa to any real degree whatsoever  I never pay any attention to them because of that  How are the demographics in New Hampshire?  Yeah, I thought so.

the thing is iowa was always going to stay a caucus because of the dumb pissing contest they have with "FITN" new hampshire  the only way sanders is at fault is that he assumed the iowa democrats were capable of running a caucus which lol.
prediction?? the dems will let Bernie take new hampshire he won it last time, the polls are extremely indicative, no big deal right?? the shit will go down again in Nevada and South Carolina where they will attempt to resuscitate Biden happy to be wrong lol.
So will CNN demand that the New Hampshire Dem primary be stopped due state being over 93% white?.
BTW New Hampshire will release 10% of its democrat primary election results at 6 pm this evening.
Yes National democratic party members are already generating sound bites to make New Hampshire the "first in nation" event The glitches and failed PR around the Caucus may have ended Iowa's time in the political light.

I don’t see why every state can’t use a primary & why there can’t be an equitable rotation so that all the states get some opportunity to go near the start instead of Iowa and New Hampshire every year, especially since they are not representative of the population’s demographics.
https://msnbccom/morning-joe/watch/sanders-leads-dem-field-in-new-hampshire-poling-shows-78073413574 …, (Sanders leads Dem field in New Hampshire) Sanders has a vivid character, outspoken That's how Trump won election Voters normally pick an aggressive candidate, to fight for their benefits Relatively politely soft-spoken, even with Whitehouse.
The new Hampshire senator road to office on her sons caskettarnishing her sons death by becoming a dem ,and shredding the Constitution he died defendingshes a perfect reason why anybody who runs for office should take a course in nowing the Constitutionshes a disgrace fireher.

I suspect even when the #IowaCaucuses results are published and finalized, many won't believe them And whether through malevolence or gross incompetence, the result is the same: people will lose faith in the fairness of elections Once you lose that, democracy is nothing.

He is a resident of New Hampshire NH didn't want him  He moved to Massachusetts and ran for governor as a republican when republican was cool, but governed as a democrat They booted him so he carpetbagged down to Mormon country  Where's he going to pitch his tent NOW???.
One state in and I'm already disgusted with the democrat party and not voting for them in the general election  Sanders is expected to win New Hampshire too so people should expect to not get the vote totals there as well.
#Iowa in years past has winnowed the presidential field and given caucus winners a burst of momentum ahead of New Hampshire, but Monday’s meltdown left Democrats deflated https://wwwwashingtontimescom/news/2020/feb/4/iowa-chaos-undercuts-democrats-new-hampshire/ ….
