Yep I have seen a bunch of California voters saying today they’re switching their vote from Warren to Biden in the California primary just to try to beat Sanders such a bummer-she’s a much better candidate! (Than both of them).
The longer this primary is, the more I want a day time talkshow for Andrew Yang.

Biden can now call himself a "young, vibrant man" since he's the youngest man in the Dem primary now.
Imagine what this race might look like if Nevada and South Carolina led the primary season instead of Iowa and New Hampshire Of course, that’s also why it’s unlikely to change.

Adam, jesus christo have some fuggin' self respect and tell her to end it before she loses MA and throws blood in the water for a primary or a Republican challenger.
South Carolina is a red state It’ll be red in November The Democrat primary voting makes up a tiny fraction of General Election voters The majority of SC Dem primary voters are black and are guided by a longtime Dem state level machine in SC In other words, they do what.
If Warren were a guy, she  wouldn't be who I vote for in the primary like Biden, Pete, and Bloomberg wouldn't be.
Sounds risky for him What does his pulmonologist or primary recommend?.
I prefer Warren over Biden, too But no, given how the primary is setting up, it is a futile vote This is elevated in 2020 because Bernie would likely lose versus Trump, destroying our constitution and elevating fascism I am being pragmatic.
Didn’t care much for Mayor Pete but this may be the smartest timed withdrawal from a primary that I can recall He looked at the chessboard and knocked his king over He was facing a wipeout on Tuesday Good luck to him ! https://twittercom/NBCNews/status/1234255254964854785 ….

Sanders supporters are celebrating the first openly gay candidate to win a presidential primary dropping out as a win for the gay community Wake up, pal.
Just to remind youmany Super Tuesday primary states have early voting so not all Buttigieg votes Of course you wouldn’t know since you and your #GOPLackeys have blatantly done away with state primaries to prevent any serious challenge to your #AutocraticReign.

They're pulling all the stops now Warren's campaign has explicitly stated that blunting Bernie's momentum is their primary goal now I think it's going to be important to get Warren voters to see that voting for Bernie is the only way they'll get a progressive in the WH.
I am just going to say it: we went from the most diverse primary in history to two septuagenarian white men leading for the dem party and a qualified women trying to get the place she deserves Some things never change #DemocraticPrimary.
Stay in your own sorry lane for oncethe Democratic primary is none of your business    Maybe get some sleep for your next bizarre press conference on the virus!!!.
It's also why Mayo Pete would never win that race He's barely struggling to be relevant in a democratic primary, let alone a statewide senatorial race lol.
I think I need to use the mute feature on some friends too I know you haven't muted me (over this) because the primary is one thing I'm not being an asshole about.
It’s still the primary Some of us want to make sure we have a candidate who can win the general That’s the goal right? Beating trump   Please stop shushing people.
Pete departure shows that McKinsey is more toxic than Castro in 2020 dem primary field.

Friendly reminder: Biden has NEVER won a state in a primary or caucus in the 30+ years he’s been running for President (1988, 2008, 2020)  But he’s the electable candidate?.
But Democrats are required to pay dues and support down ballot races He doesn't do any of that In fact, his group is trying primary form the left elected representatives the y feel aren't progressive enough.

If she dropped out now she’d still be on the ballot, but she’s one of the least popular senators by constituency anyhow so dropping out before that primary would actually be a good political move for her She has bad political instincts though so .
Republicans lost a Senate seat in Alabama because they rallied behind Steve Bannon’s pick  In 2012 they lost two easy pick ups in MO and Indiana, because right wing nutjobs won those primaries  Kansas has a Dem Governor because Kobach won the primary.

You’re right, I’m not afraid, these children think that if you yell and wag your finger, things will magically happen 50 votes, maybe 60 are required to pass anything in the senate The primary season is almost over, so they’d have to wait until 2022 to unseat any Dems.

Joe Biden hasn't campaigned in any Super Tuesday states in over a month I wonder how that will pan out #SCprimary2020.
democrats literally turned out in the gop primary and voted for trump because they thought he would lose the general to HRC  so, uh, oops.
Does Biden win by a lot? 20% or more? A little? Or does Bernie pull a surprise upset and get close or win? Polls close in 2 minutes #scprimary2020.
Flipping between college basketball and the SC Primary results not a bad Saturday evening! #SCprimary2020 #UGA.
MSM seems preoccupied with race in the South Carolina primary Didn’t hear that much about race before or after the New Hampshire primary Maybe it says something about which candidate they favor.
6+6=12 The percentage of Republicans voting in the open Democratic primary I doubt those numbers are coincidental.
A huge impediment to Sanders’ 2016 campaign was the unanimous narrative that Clinton would win the primary and the general That influenced a lot of votes, and with Sanders now the frontrunner (by a lot!) and best positioned to beat Trump it’s an entirely different situation.

This is a classic example of misinterpreting statistics Comparing republican votes to democrats’ in a primary, when the republican president is the incumbent and has no primary opposition leads to no useful conclusions.
Ah yes the intellect of the left Can't present any useful ideas so they revert to their primary school days and use curse words Hope your education wasn't too expensive, I'd ask for my money back.
This is no doubt due in some part to Republicans not having a primary and crossing over to vote.
Either would draw such a huge contrast to trump which is what we need I’d prefer Castro but I can see an agreement why Harris would be a good strategic choice if it was announced before the primary is over.

What's worse is this never-ending primary season with his opponents sniping at each other endlessly   Ok, not worse, but equally as annoying.
It's too late for that Backing the Green Party candidate (presumably Hawkins) is our best option at this point (Still gonna vote Tulsi in the primary, of course).
I voted absentee in Missouri today I Got To Vote Twice!  Well, once for next week's primary election and once for an April special election Figured I'd get both done since flu season has gone odd Yes, the election judges were having fun with 2 for 1 voting!.
I hope so!  He got my vote in the Maine primary    Experts like @CookPolitical don’t see a realistic path for Bernie now  He’s done himself in in Florida with pro-Castro comments, for example.
absolutely yes if we don’t i’ll cry ????? also did u know that the risca primary lot did not experience wacky warehouse.
I really paid minimal attention to folks until about a month ago so I could vote in the primary and I’ll be going back into hiding until November because I’m going to do what I have to do come then This election season isn’t about to steal my peace this time.

The last Democrat debate of the primary is about to come on, it’s likely going to be messy & I’m okay with that tonight.
Maybe because the reply I answered suggested that was somehow relevant to the Democratic primary  Reading comprehension It might help you to work your skills up there.

Saw a piece somewhere that said public personalities (Tom Hanks, Brazil Prez office etc) both interact more w people so are more susceptible to being primary patients and also have better  access to tests Which is why, they are the more prominent cases.
If Bernie RKO’s Biden on stage does he lock up the primary?.
I actually do see a choice in the Democratic presidential primary that matches your assertion I won't go with that without specific mention of Reality because I've spent two years watching her be the exception when anything worthwhile is mentioned.
Biden brings being the winner of the primary and ending Bernie as a presidential candidate forever He deserves sainthood.

You all keep saying stuff like that even though the FACTS are that MORE Bernie voters voted for Hillary than Hillary voters voted for Obama And you NEVER consider that many, many Bernie voters are IND and joined Dem party (where they had to) for the primary VBNH wont work.

You know you went to a CofE primary school when you can just be going about your normal everyday life 20 years later and suddenly your brain starts singing “from the tiny ant”.
Yeah This is a manufactured economic crisis My point is that republicans are voting in the primary for no particular reason other than to select trump the numbers are quite big Everyone ignores it It’s wild.

This primary made me realize how much of an echo chamber we live in on these websites We have to figure out a way to break out of it Also, the younger voter % was insanely favored for Bernie, but still Old people.

the michigan primary took place only one week after Trump became the frontrunner and he wasn’t yet the presumptive nominee not denying sexism outright, but how do you account for trump as a factor in your analysis?.
I'm in the same boat! Ms Warren was the best candidate and I voted for her in my primary as well   But yes, on to the Senate! @AmyMcGrathKY is by far one of the most important campaigns in the Senate Even if by some miracle the GOP keeps the Senate, #MoscowMitch will be gone.
I'm confused, are you a republican voting the primary?.
The idea that gladhanding inside the Dem establishment would have made any real difference strikes me as wishful Beltway thinking  Failing to deliver huge youth turnout was the important, central failure of the campaign, a failure @AOC must study for 2024's Dem primary.

Usa hospitals especially those in urban areas have spent the last 20 yr's pretending to be able to do it all (primary care, women's health) and they've shown 0 interest for collaborating with outside providers Hopefully they'll change tracks if not, yes they'll face overfill.
I have to do a primary source paper on a painting that was remade by the same guy over 100 times Edward Hicks you were one dedicated man #college.
Let's be real, the closure of some polling locations are only in working class districts where Bernie is set to do well, not due to Coronavirus DNC rigging the primary again all over this country.

Bernie had nothing to do with her losing It's a talking point that was used to weaken him in future runs and Hillary just once again not being accountable for her failures Link me to Bernie trashing her? Policy contrasts are not trashing in a primary.
I voted Bernie in the California primary but he's getting fucked hard by all fronts by the media and now he's 150 candidates behind Biden   So yeah imma just vote Vermin unless Bernie is nominated by some miracle.
And the high school and primary schools have small classrooms with a whole heap a kids close to each other.

Dude was denying that cigarettes were making people sick as recently as 2000  The surgeon general started putting warning labels on packs in the 1960s  He has a record of being anti science  Not to mention he’s Trump’s primary bootlicker  This does not inspire confidence!.
In a lot of "red" areas, there IS no Dem candidate, in the primary OR the general election That's the case where I live Maybe, just MAYBE, two Republicans will be fighting it out for one race Usually not It's already decided.

His views on Biden are interesting  This article was from early last summer, and given the state of the race right now, it makes me wonder even more if he might be supporting Bernie  He did say, however, that he would not endorse during the primary process.

This primary is not over folks Yesterday Louisiana postpones their primary And now breaking a few minutes ago Georgia just announced they are postponing their primary Way too many curveballs being thrown on a daily basis in a very volatile environment.
Bernie already lost the primary This is a waste of time.
@GovMikeDeWine and I don't see eye to eye on much and we don't vote in the same primary, but he deserves credit for meeting #COVIDー19 head on and being proactive for our state.

Voter suppression? In the Dem primary? By whom?  Then they better vote Biden if he gets nominated, or their entire lives will be shit if trump is in there another 4 years.

That's right! Biden isn't "winning", he's being helped by the party and their owners/donors So many different ways of trying to interfere in the primary We've seen it all before The party has no idea what they are really up against #BernersUnite #Bernie2020.
@BarackObama  Mr President, I know u don't want to interfere in the Dem primary, but after watching a video of Mr Biden's behavior & public comments during the campaign, it's pretty clear he is not well Please do something private or public He's unfit, just like trump.

How is a political class of Democratic Party elites determining the future direction for its voters while using a theatre of catastrophe to suppress  the turnout in its primary any different than the fascism they so desperately want to defeat? #VoteFreedom2020.

So the general election Utah could go in October, Ohio in September? You realize the DNC doesn't even need to have a primary right? They can just let elites pick You also know they can standardize it all however they want They can require it all on a single day.
Yeah, you know that the Dem Primaries are more than just the vote for the president? You get to primary for senators and reps?  How will you vote in the next AOC to supplant a moderate if you aren't there to vote for them?.

Ha Utah, with six electoral votes, has backed the Republican presidential candidate in every election for more than half a century and yet they voted for Bernie Sanders in this primary What does that tell you? They still back Trump and Romney is a fraud Integrity? Ha.
tbh that's one of the biggest rays of hope for bernies primary chances biden voters dont give a fuck about biden, they just want a "safe" choice as evidenced by his inability to pull votes from pete, klob, etc without them dropping any big hit to the momentum & "safety" is huge.
Just got a call from @BernieSanders campaign about the upcoming primary Guy on the phone did not seem to want to engage me at all when I said I was uncommitted following @ewarren - not that I wasn't going to vote, not that I'd decided against their guy, just undecided 1/3.
I never got to vote for her Our primary is 3/10 .

#NotMeUs is about coalition building, not pushing people out One thing my fellow Bernie supporters, myself included, need to work on if we want to turn this primary around is to win over hearts and minds Convert people, instead of dog piling them.
Also have every state do their primary at the same time My state hasn't gone yet but so many candidates have dropped out already The early states get too much power in deciding a whole party's candidate Fuuuuuuck that honestly.
Can you and Pete come to Arizona before our primary Bernie is here tonight and we need to crush him here.
Between Biden and Bernie- I’m thinking FL will go Biden in the primary.
Our primary isn’t until June 3rd, so I have a feeling it won’t matter I don’t know that I would’ve been able to vote for Bloomberg, but between Bernie & Joe, I’ll vote for whoever the nominee is.
Did they think she couldn’t win because they thought she would run an inferior campaign or because she thought others wouldn’t vote for her in the general due to her gender? The second case implies the primary voters aren’t sexist but believe voters in the general are.

Obama is beloved by liberals, and as far as I've seen the leftists loathe him But that aside, if we're counting election losses as the barometer of success then losing the primary election before you even get the GE is a failure, so I can't understand the faith in Bernie.

I don't think you understand what the ballot looks like You mark which primary you're voting in on for sorting and to make sure you don't vote in both primaries  Then the ballot itself has all the candidates in both primaries This is to prevent dual voting.
Omg! @JoyAnnReid finally mentioned the 2016 WA primary results.
Whatever happens after this primary we have to hold each other up and keep fighting I look to leaders like you to point to the real progressives or run for office yourself one day.
Really hoping tonight we get some wins and some momentum so we can win this primary and go on to beat Donald Trump in the general election.

@maddow Bernie will lose in WA tonight  in 2016, he invaded the caucus and won the delegates  In the Primary that year Hillary skunked him but it didn't count  In 2020 with a primary, he will get skunked again.
Wish that mattered in the primary it’s so dumb.
Why Biden? Simple, Bernie took a lot of the oxygen out of the primary for everyone else Biden for all his faults, was the only one who could put together a coalition to stop him Mostly because of the black vote, which nobody else but Sanders & Biden were getting.
You are a disgrace to our country and the office you hold The corruption runs deep the bribes never end to convenient that 3 weeks ago Biden was below most of the candidates, then all of a sudden he gets all these endorsements and he is top in the primary Obama and Hillary?.

885,000 voted in the 2020 primary 318,000 voted in the 2016 caucuses So @Ilhan wants to keep the vote away from over half a million Minnesotans in order to protect Bernie.

I am furious about the primary results as it regards @ewarren I am not being a fan boy, but do you think if it was a man who was highly educated, a senator, a public advocate & had started a federal agency, he would have been ignored like this too?.
I’m by no means a Biden fan, but the bounce today was because of him The fall last week was Bernie getting traction (winning Iowa, NH, Nevada primary, leading polls, etc).
Will y'all shut the fuck up the primary isn't even done yet Bernie hasn't lost anything Shut the fuck up.

Not true Warren didn’t take my vote from anyone; she won it I would not, under any circumstances, have voted for Sanders in the primary He will get my begrudging vote ONLY if he’s the Dem nominee in November I’m not the system I’m just one voter.
I disagree, I was a pretty big Warren supporter at the outset of the primary Most Warren supporters I know are excited about her being all about "bug structural change," and I think it more of a leap to back Biden than Bernie who is also about big structural change.
Likely Unpopular Opinion: I think you should pay as close of attention to your state Legislature as you do the presidential primary.
Rather than attack fellow Democrats, I'd like to hear Bernie and his supporters attack Trump and how their plan will right the ship I'll then decide who's best to vote for in my primary Right now, attacks on fellow Dems hurts your chances of getting my vote.
Wow can someone please primary that fake-Democrat?.
Bernie is not a Democrat The party and its members are in no way required to facilitate his coup They’re primarying the party down ballot, do no fundraising etc.
Dudedid you see the numbers that turned out for a primary? Damn you are in trouble.
mom caucused for Bernie in ‘16 & dad voted in the primary  They are poor working class, parents of 4 with two incomes & never connected w/or trusted a politician til they heard Bernie speak Also they never felt their vote would matter  They are far from alone.
I have a different take on Bloomberg He is like the artillery when you need smoke His smoke was 500 million bucks kicking Sanders and Trump while Biden was out of money It's a 500 million dollar campaign contribution in the Tuesday primary Sanders can't go over 30% so UNITY.
I love Warren but will vote Joe in our primary because now we need to coalesce.
Just so we're clear, the whole purpose of super delegates is to be free to vote as they wish independent of how the majority vote And in 1984 they did just that Mondale did not win the primary Until super delegates took the vote away from the people Fact #Resist.
Trump and the GOP is dismantling our democracy But now anyone who voted and supports Biden is now a target of Sanders and his followers We're "the establishment," we "rigged the primary" It's almost like the DNC marched voters at gun point to vote for Biden Strange times.

A bit subjective I believe it was for the benefit of the country  If bernie can’t even get his youth base to turn out, or the actual majority of democratic voters to agree with him in the primary, then how the hell can he beat Trump?.

Not sure what your point is I'm saying it's bad that they're changing debates into town halls mid primary you're just telling me the DNC doesnt like Bernie and Bernie doesn't like them I think they may be doing it to help Biden and it sounds like maybe you agree.
My state is a closed primary state I've always been a gypsy.
More than excited to cast my vote for @TulsiGabbard in Alabama’s primary tomorrow!!.
PLEASE GO FUCKING EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE!!! California primary elections end tomorrow .
you got detention in your primary school ?!?.
That's kind of the point of having a primary isn't it ?.
It is all parties primary tomorrow  Wow.
I can’t vote in this primary till April and I don’t even know anymore if that’s a good or a bad thing This primary is too damned long Sorry to the May and June states.
Just sitting tight on Kauai, our primary is August 8th  You all have fun deciding before we even vote!.
Sweet! My primary is next week, also can't wait!.
Oh! Btw Drew, apologies for bothering you, but do you have your primary coloring scheme in any sort of shareable file? If so, I’d love to steal it from you (if you’re okay with that!).

Oh, I'm not either I'm happy for her whatever path she chooses to take  Since she dropped out I had leaned towards Amy K , but now that she's out I'll be voting Joe Biden in my states primary  Just pointing out I'd be ecstatic to support a ticket with her as VP.
ok a little disappointed klobuchar dropped out before our primary was excited to see her loose her own state.
There’s not a clearer explanation of how you should vote during a primary  #warren.
No, I'm worried Warren will drop out before the PA primary I have a bad feeling she'll drop out after tomorrow, if she doesn't have a strong showing.
I don’t think I can reasonably live through this primary and fight depression at the same time The rate of sad, hypocritical takes have reached galactic levels and I’m pretty sure it means Trump will win again I can’t even muster up the strength to hope I’m wrong.
this is how he communicates at a rally you can't parse policy like a wonk and expect normal people to follow your point this is also one of the reasons that warren is under-performing in the primary.
If you live in one of tomorrow's primary states, make sure your voice is heard with a vote This will be the most important general election in modern history, so let's make sure we put up a great candidate.
Your primary coverage tonight completely omitted a candidate - @ewarren is still in the race She has more delegates (of the 4% decided) than Bloomberg, polling second in CA Why? #warrenerasure #ChooseWarren.
She literally can’t In every primary so far, Warren has been behind in progressive votes Don’t make shit up that can be proven false with one Google search https://twittercom/JulianCastro/status/1234569073733898240 ….
I was one of your biggest supporters, and I am now voting for Bernie in the primary PLEASE have a talk with the Sanders campaign and help reestablish a Department of Technology and endorse him!.
People seem to forget that, for a time, JR was the primary ball handler/playmaker for the Knicks, during his tenure there  Yes, it's the "Knicks"  That aside, he showed himself a very capable all around player  Not just a streaky shooter.
He already kind of has He told his supporters to vote for Bernie in the primary.
Is that why she hasn’t even gotten to 2nd place in literally every fucking primary state thus far?.
Skew plays a role sure, but not as much the initial delta Delta decay  It depends on the situation, what product, which strikes, term structure etc  IMO ATM/OTM fly's are pure skew trades My primary trade is ATM put fly's into steep skew.
It's weird, but it also makes some sense The PPE is closed, meaning you have to be a registered Democrat The primary is open In a year where Trump doesn't even have a PPE in Arizona, I'm glad the GOP can't vote in ours If it were a primary they could.
Just vote for who you like the most It's a primary - never know how it's gonna shake out.
Serious question:  when will the Dems change the primary rules to closed?.
If you live abroad, don't forget that the Democrats Abroad primary starts tomorrow and runs through March 10th! Vote, vote wherever you are!! Feel the Bern, too.

@ewarren is getting my vote  I may have to suck it up and #VoteBlueNoMatterWho in the end but not in the primary!.
Lol you first, bud Don’t like being called a sexist? Then quit telling women they’re wasting their primary vote (which they aren’t) by voting for a viable female presidential candidate  Either be an adult and promote your guy without beating down others or STFU Very easy .
I was joking She only gets a few votes every time, and I bet if she dropped, her supporters wouldn’t bother with the primary.
His first primary win in 44 year’s 3rd time he’s run for President in that time period.
Yes but I cast my vote for Sanders in the 2016 primary and since then I've come to see him as a shill who can't get anything done I'm PRACTICAL Also I have a lot of problems with much of Sander's behaviors, his actions, his going back on transparency with medical recordsetc.
The media is putting its thumb on the scale of this primary via this kind of terrible and sexist media coverage Be better It’s not that hard.
if he didn’t vote in the primary dump  him .
Avoiding watching the TV pundits chasing their tails over every incoming percentage of primary districts There's no need I'll get the proper results tomorrow.
i am very anxiously awaiting these primary results because i do not trust this city to do the right thing when i get smashed in the face by a backpack on the subway every god damn day.
election-year reminder that if you could have voted in the primary, and chose not to vote in the primary, then i don't want to hear you complaining about the candidate come november.
You do understand that it's not going to matter who wins the Democratic primary right?.
I’m just gonna open random precinct maps in Photoshop and go wild with the paint bucket tool for the RTs  It’ll be time for the Illinois primary before anyone realizes what I’ve done.
Good luck to all the Democrats running in the primary!  Not an easy process and not a job most Americans would like to have but like to criticize you all have earned respect! #VoteBlueNoMatterWho.
That's funny I voted in my primary too but in Minnesota I voted for President Donald J Trump   Four more years.

Doesn’t this sort of defeat the purpose of a primary??.
Biden wiped the floor with Bernie among African Americans in South Carolina primary this year, are you kidding? They trust Biden more than Bernie  You’ll see same in Georgia and Alabama soon, too, and elsewhere in the South.
Donna brazille who leaked debate questions to Hillary in 2016 getting upset about people saying the DNC is trying to prevent bernie from winning the primary and telling him he should work with the establishment is the kind of thing that led to trump.
I voted! If your in a primary state today you should vote too! #SuperTuesday.
Yo if @BernieSanders wins the primary, we’re still going to push him on SESTA/FOSTA, right? Like that’s why we want someone like him in office, right?.
Both parties do that Haven’t you been following the Dem primary?.
Republicans who are going to vote for trump in the general are voting in the Democratic primary.
Exit polls under-count young voters, who tend to vote by mail  In California’s 2016 primary, 59% of the votes cast were by mail-in ballots In the 2018 primary, 68% were  Why do we keep suffering through the same hot takes every 2 years?.

I voted early in this primary, but I remember years ago, standing in line for 3 hours after work to vote in a presidential election & for an independent candidate who didn't have a snowball's chance of winning It was the principle of the thing We can vote We should vote.
i know a Nebraskan who is a Bloomberg supporter and thats why i fully support their primary being last.
Agreed on both  But, I saw someone say today that "The primary is about you, the general is about the nation" or something like that.

Absolutely! But if we get to the convention with, say, Biden having won the red states and Bernie the blue, shouldn't we go with the sure blue thing? and/or look at who wins WI, MI, PA, FL, OH in the primary and back them .
I hope I care enough about the next primary to remember I can go in a week early.

I remember that screen name as one of the ppl I had to mute years ago bc they went from posturing as a radlib to a full-throated establishment moderate the exact moment Bernie Sanders decided to run in the 2016 primary.
The Democrats’ first four contests include two caucuses, an open primary, and a semi-open primary (And the first two contests are in nearly all-white states) Hard to imagine a worse way to start the nominating process.
Yes, let's leave the liberals to handle this considering how well they've done with the primary voting ???? FYI, your party also believes in letting an infant die if the parent wishes so you hardly value LIFE!.

They've done far worse and it didn't spark anything Why should they think this would be any different?  Bottom line is, as much as I hate to admit it, the left is all talk 90% of Bernie's primary voters in 2016 voted for Hillary despite irrefutable proof of rigging.
It's dumb guy politics analysis, but I have a hard time understanding how Joe Biden, who has not yet won or come close to winning a primary, is suddenly expected to win like 6 in four days.
I think you're supposed to point out differences in candidates in a primary How else are you supposed to select a candidate?.

In @ewarren Twitter thread cited, she talks about gen'l elections NOT primary elections, you know PARTY primaries/caucuses where PARTY gets to choose PARTY's candidate for president AND gets to choose PARTY rules for the process She doesn't like SDs but abides by PARTY rules.
I just voted (via absentee ballot) for @ewarren in the CA primary and it felt GREAT  10/10, highly recommended~   #TeamWarren #VoteWarrenpictwittercom/nTUipkyDwd.
You vote because the party decided to have a number of delegates chosen based on the vote of the people, but not all of the delegates are selected this way Again, we don’t have a right to pick a nominee For most of our history neither party used a national primary.
There are many reasons why I will not be voting for Bernie in the primary But scenes like these (and I grew up in VT going to “Bernie Barbecues” with my step-dad and seeing this exact scenario play out probably 100x) is why I’ll be happy voting for him should he get the Dem nod https://twittercom/MikeElk/status/1233529483405205504 ….

@johniadarola is spot on, Democrats suppress the primary and Republicans suppress the general This is how the vulture class maintain a semblance of democracy while controlling the whole mess through a veil of corrupt and deceitful machinations #tytlive.
Y’know, even though I have a memory of voting for Edwards somehow, I’m doing the math and I didn’t turn 18 until 3 months after that primary, so I’m not sure what I’m remembering.
A third of the vote isn’t the will of the people It’s a primary system that isn’t designed for the 21st Century which encourages candidates to stay in come what may and bargain making.
'Privileged' is losing the popular vote in the primary and getting the support of *every superdelegate*, thereby taking the nomination SDs were there to prevent a Trump, not a Sanders  I promise I won't stay home, but I won't vote for the candidate if we have a Hillary 20.

I don’t believe you are protecting him by playing him at “small forward”  I think either way, in a crunch time slot in the playoffs, you want him as a primary on Giannis with help.
