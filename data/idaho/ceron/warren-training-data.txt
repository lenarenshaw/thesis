This is a good message and why Warren is still my top choice She has done great work holding the powerful accountable for their corrupt and criminal actions and I would love to see it continue with the full power of the executive branch behind her https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1227642418650062850 ….
warren's bad political instincts would still be a factor do you think that she'd have succeeded in spite of that?.

Bernie has changed the things seen as radical to things the majority of Americans want (Medicare for all, etc) I think he has the strongest campaign of the Democrats and I think he is very good at avoiding bad questions like that CNN warren attack on him.

@sidney_b Regarding your comment in the 538 live blog, about "warren erasure" in the media I thnk 538 was guilty of that after Iowa also The podcast just glossed over her, even though she almost tied Buttigieg in the first alignment She was not in some distant third finish.

Nope  Missing a big portion of the democratic base not being represented with that ticket  Nope Many won’t come out to vote  Instead of warren need someone more diverse Not another east coaster.
I’d only support it with Warren as president  I believe that warren will fight corporate America, and if you ask me that’s why we’re in trouble I don’t think Bloomberg will fight corporate money in politics and polical favors She’s just what we need.
I can’t stand warren or polosi ot the satan silent partner killary, yes I spelled t right her an bill have more dead body’s in there years of politics it’s amazing they have not been questioned on at least 10!.

blame liz warren for that, she mischaracterized groups like our revolution as “dark money” when all they are are grassroots organizations designed to boost progressive candidates, it was a total snake move .
there is in fact video from about the time period warren claimed that bernie said a woman couldn't be president in which Bernie says he thinks a woman COULD be president.

Don’t care plus you’re a warren voter.
This is an excellent article: Warren Is Paying the Price for her Honesty And Her Gender https://washingtonmonthlycom/2020/02/15/warren-is-paying-the-price-for-her-honesty-and-her-gender/#XksoseAUyWptwitter … #Sexism.
Will @ewarren , @BernieSanders condemn this  $10 Billion bc it is coming from a billionaire?   Obviously, like Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, these funds are set up to help avoid taxation It is legal If Berners want to control these funds, then change the tax policies.
Created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by 2008 returned $12 BILLION to 29 million people Proven brain trust #warren #warren2020.
So, I am undecided I was kamala, now I don’t know  Why warren over Amy? I don’t know who to choose.
Sure, even though the second choice for both Biden and warren supporters (mostly) goes to Bernie You know those two states (that Bernie won) are a small slice of the total, right? They were mostly white states (which isn't representative of his coalition).
A Bloomberg nomination ensures a loss to Trump but ensures he never has to pay warren or sanders’ wealth taxes and saves $356 billion https://twittercom/ggreenwald/status/1229501546955759617 ….
I know Bloomberg is sexist racist not any better than Trump If this is the choice we have I have a hard time b/c we as Dems deserve better than just voting for anyone @ewarren still the best canidate out there She needs $$$$ so chip in to help her out!.
guttenberg has been smearing Bernie’s campaign for weeks yesterday he made false claims that bernie’s supporters were protesting joe biden with a coffin symbolizing the death of his campaign It was actually a group that had endorsed elizabeth warren.

I think stealing a culture and using it for personal gain provides important context about someone Like I said I do like warren, I just think it’s bs that she doesn’t have to answer to that, trump would back her into a corner with it in a GE.
uh ok bloomberg isn't in the headline, but he IS in the article warren isn't anywhere  reminder: elizabeth warren is in third place in delegates pictwittercom/TUyRteZoy8.
I will vote for the best candidate to beat Trump like a drum!I only wished @HillaryClinton ran again & told  Sanders what he could go with himselfCause he did it again to @ewarren & he’s getting another pass of underhandedness which he’s supporting since he has never apologized.
He’s The Godfather of those positions warren stole His ideas than went back on them once she got owned by Amy and Pete at a debate warren is completely self serving I say this is an ex supporter of hers.

Well they have similar policies but Bernie has heart and passion to this and the biggest movement of any candidate Bernie has had these ideas and goals all his life unlike warren.
I remember the time when we asked them to raise concern that Bernie is constantly misplaced in polls with warren, always with benefit to her.

no warren supports a public option and then eventually in a distant uncertain future maybe a pathway to the possibility of considering m4a.
They were warren supporters, but I’m guessing you know that already.
yeah, i thought the heart attack was it -- i was 100000% sure warren was gonna take it when that happened was the main reason i didn't sell all my shares (i had nearly 100k warren shares across markets) but the exact opposite happened politics is funny, it really is.
