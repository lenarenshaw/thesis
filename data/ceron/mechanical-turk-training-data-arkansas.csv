WTH!!!! Another democrat. Probably has everyone do everything for her!!!,arkansas
All focus should have been about winning the next election. Instead they have sacrificed Biden in a doomed mission. I don't see the US electing a communist or a delusional liar so that leaves Pete,arkansas
"Do you want someone who appeals to 16% of the population? Or do you want someone who appeals to 60% of the population?  In binary, the more of them voting for us the Less they have voting for them. If Sanders is the nom, that 42% goes to trump. If yang. That 42% comes from trump",arkansas
not likely. The Biden's on the other hand... May not wind up as fortunate.,arkansas

America has a chance to save the forrest and the trees with Bloomberg. The fact he made serious cash is of little concern to me. Trump/ Bloomberg debates would end Trump's peverted hold on a whole parcel of good Americans. The union man specifically.  Moms for the children too!,arkansas
"Whatever u say whatever u do u will always be the petty crook who got impeached. The narcissist too stupid to hide his crimes. The joke the world laughs at. The victors write history my friend. If Dem is next they'll crucify u, a Rep will distance themselves, blame u 4 whats next",arkansas
