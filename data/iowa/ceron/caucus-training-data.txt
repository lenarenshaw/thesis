My new ride for the next few days, guess what I'm distributing?  ;) #caucus #IACaucus (Survived the slush)  Weather made it really hard and had to cancel a couple of stops but glad John Grennan PowDems and iowa county are well on their way!pictwittercom/uehlnh8tDP.
Like, you WILL see a lot of Pete supporters ending up caucusing for Bernie if he's below the threshold because they're ultimately not that ideological and if Bernie is leading and has a ton of energy and support in the caucus process people just wanna join that.
He dropped out after placing third in the Ames straw poll He didnt even make it to the caucus.
I went to my state's presidential caucus assuming that it would be like an election, but it wasn't My preferred candidate didn't meet the threshold, and I ended the caucus supporting my second-favorite candidate https://twittercom/KateLambert4/status/1215784126852272130 ….
Let's play a game: Spot the Yang Gang! 2 out of 20 new Yang supporters in Burlington, Iowa 10 Republicans, 2 Libertarians, and 8 Democrats committed to caucus in 2 days of canvassing #Yang2020pictwittercom/dAHtkyABjv.
Bernie Sanders leads the Iowa Poll https://wwwdesmoinesregistercom/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2020/01/10/iowa-poll-2020-bernie-sanders-lead-iowa-caucus-president-election/4426492002/ …pictwittercom/HKsCMrDoEd.
The percentage of those who say their mind is made up about which candidate to support on caucus night has risen to 40% up 10 percentage points from Nov-45% who say they could still be persuaded to support someone else and another 13% who have not picked a favorite candidate yet.
Bernie Sanders took the top spot in the race to the February 3 caucuses in the latest Iowa Poll, published by the Des Moines Register and CNN https://globegazettecom/news/sanders-leads-new-iowa-poll/article_f3bfe35b-6a25-5158-a7f4-49ff2ee0a9f1html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter_globegazette ….
To those who are not fans of Bernie Sanders, would you vote for him over Trump? vhttps://wwwdesmoinesregistercom/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2020/01/10/iowa-poll-2020-bernie-sanders-lead-iowa-caucus-president-election/4426492002/ https://wwwdesmoinesregistercom/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2020/01/10/iowa-poll-2020-bernie-sanders-lead-iowa-caucus-president-election/4426492002/ ….
Among Democratic caucus-goers who say their support is not going to change:  Sanders: 59% Warren: 48% Biden: 44% Buttigieg: 40%  https://wwwdesmoinesregistercom/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2020/01/10/iowa-caucuses-2020-iowa-poll-pete-buttigieg-third-place/4426516002/ ….
According to their own web site the dems welcome Sanders into their caucus for his vote but when it comes to him joining in their presidential primary all the sudden he needs to go away because he isn't a real democrat    https://wwwdemocratssenategov/about-senate-dems/our-caucus ….
So, Iowa - some dude who's NOT a Democrat leads the poll of likely caucus goers Idiots Out Walking Around.
Just weeks before the Iowa caucus, all hands on deck https://twittercom/elles_ryan/status/1215776484553641984 ….
SC yes NV I wouldn't bet on it It's a caucus, Bernie does well with Democratic Hispanic primary voters and if he wins IA/NH he's probably also winning a plurality of whites.
With the Iowa caucuses less than a month away, a new poll shows a highly competitive four-way race between Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Biden http://huffpst/uPONscx .

Its the day of the Iowa caucus, and Biden is in 4th place Biden has no chance to make up the deficit At that moment, thousands of elderly black men with chains and razors bust into the caucus halls It's the Corn Pop gang Sanders supporters flee for the hills Biden wins.
I would support a new conservative political party, but pro-balanced budget  That party could caucus with the @GOP when they have mutual agreement & a need for majorities  I would call it "The T Party" — "T" for "Trump"!  @DonaldJTrumpJr should run it, as his dad is kinda busyhttps://twittercom/JackPosobiec/status/1215766002941775874 ….

One would think But all the facts point otherwise It isn’t trump I don’t like, though he an idiot It’s where the entire GOP stands today I left the caucus a couple years ago because there is no facts, or reason behind their actions Other than being bought by corps.
Different Precincts are worth a different amount of delegates to the County convention, where another mini-caucus takes place to elect delegates to the State convention, where a third mini-caucus takes place to elect delegates to the National convention.
A new poll, widely considered the most authoritative in Iowa, shows Sanders surging to first place as all eyes are on the state ahead of caucuses  http://hillcm/lpFob11 .
The polls have shown up and down and all over the place Esp in a caucus state, it's the enthusiasm that will make it Keep the faith!! He's still in a very good position.
Yes, this is true I know, I've participated in a presidential caucus https://twittercom/sch834/status/1215781837584375808 ….
That MINUS 9 for Pete in Iowa in the best rated poll for that state a month before the caucus? He’s toast Jeezus Something’s happening in Iowa alright - and it ain’t good news for the Buttigieg campaign.
Honestly no idea, but I did appreciate the comparison of DMR polls to caucus results.
If Yang could achieve 5% in DMR poll, it means he's a good chance to surprise the world come caucus day I've never seen him crossing 2% in your poll.
It will be proof that lily-white Iowa and its anachronistic caucus system is beyond irrelevant   Next week from Bill Scher: Is the presidency itself relevant? https://twittercom/peterdaou/status/1215776376499908616 ….
The interesting thing will be if those young Bernie supporters show up on caucus night You know the older Biden ones will https://twittercom/Bidar411/status/1215780765637783553 ….
My second choice is Sanders at the caucus.
2/ But Hillary got 38,168 more votes than Bernie in the actual primary She cleaned his clock, but Bernie got 3/4 of the delegates Most of my fam lives in  WA and they are still seething over this Not one of them was able to attend the caucuses.
I was a Bernie supoorter but now I plan to caucus for Kamala in Iowa let's go kween!.

Getting all trained for Caucus night in just a few short weeks! Can’t believe it’s almost here and can’t wait to caucus for @PeteButtigieg #TeamPete #WinTheErapictwittercom/eBF9AHZaiN.
If you trust the President and support the President, why did you vote for this? Veterans in your caucus didn’t vote for this! What the hell were you thinking? Dems will never agree to allow retaliation against Iran You have tied the President’s hands This is shameful.
This isn't really new The caucus preference ballot worked essentially the same way and primaries for non presidential offices don't even require an oath regarding party Mischief making seems to have been minimal.
*checks the 16 primary results on ElectionAtlas* So, sorta like how 2016 went until Michigan? (The 3 primaries Clinton lost thru Super-Tuesday were NH/OK/VT with caucus losses in states that now have primaries).

Until a few months ago, Sanders was our second pick Now, we're not sure we could support him at all You all assume you'll sweep Yangsters in the caucuses, for example, but the Sandersite attitudes online have lost him a lot of goodwill.
Ugh this is exactly what Pelosi would say and yea it probably fits the worried mood of the caucus but like I’d rather her say ok that’s it we’re blocking this tomorrow https://twittercom/AlexNBCNews/status/1214697034969702400 ….
Do you have any interest in voting for Yang? It doesn’t appear so I have decided not to vote for Sanders I caucused for him last time and changed my mind Neither of us is uninformed I can respect your opinion, I just don’t agree I just want the same respect from Berners.

Thank you, Sir Please work within your caucus to get more GOPers to speak out.
Watch, though, as Trump is completely unable to realize any credibility gains as a result of this In fact as of this he’s lost two Republicans from the caucus.
Hi @RepLawrence, I'm a constituent of yours With just a few weeks til the Iowa caucus, I'm asking you to endorse @ewarren for president.

President Barack Obama won the Democratic Party nomination by securing more than the required 2,383 delegates on April 3, 2012 after a series of primary elections and caucuses.

Cactus caucus captains, I like it.
You hear about Bloomberg & Steyer trying to buy the nomination but I had no idea thatStatus Quo Joe's dark money SuperPAC spent $23 million on Iowa TV ads alone He's at 15% (& dropping) in Iowa, the minimum to make it out of the 1st round of caucusing  https://bitly/2QHX6Bw pictwittercom/N2mlkzzXO8.
And yet, HRC crushed Bernie in the primaries He even lost vanity primaries in states he won by caucus  AOC could have run as a green, or an American socialist She ran as a Dem because she wanted a chance to win  Most Sanders backed challengers lost Important to remember.
its a caucus, 8% of iowans are excited about biden, don't be an idiot.
I'd love to know what the demographics are of Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa  At least winning Iowa isn't necessarily a predictor for winning New Hampshire  https://wwwpoliticocom/news/magazine/2020/01/09/iowa-caucus-democrats-2020-096337 ….
But they committed to caucus for @CoryBooker !!.
We're not going for top 3 We're winning!  50,000 Iowans to caucus for Yang All we need.
He’s a Democratic Socialist who caucuses with democrats in the senate He’s more of a democrat in policy and voting record than democrats should be The party of the people and the working class, remember? Now it’s just the party of the corporate shills and Wall Street hoes.

So like you can stay in Iowa through the caucus rigggghhhht? .
Why does this matter? Democrats aren’t disagreeing on policy - the progressive caucus tends to agree w/ him Democrats hold the center, but the ctr & the right aren’t repping a lot of the country right now If America had a viable labor party, Bernie would probably be that.
It's tough to poll Iowa cos it's a caucus, Biden will eat shit there.
Republican candidates are chosen by caucus in Utah, and then the voters are stuck with them  That caucus system is the problem.
@AarikaSamone is doing such a phenomenon job She met with Suzanne Herzog who might caucus for Yang She’s also running for senator!!

A majority of the caucus felt the Mueller obstruction charges WERE serious high crimes that mandated impeachment, even though she said they weren't worth it I like politicians who can say "I was wrong" or at least "I got outvoted".
She didn't impeach Bush for the same reasons she waited several months to impeach Trump: she has a House majority to protect and she wasn't going to sacrifice her caucus if she knew she didn't have the votes to support a long-odds impeachment process.
Folks, snow joke! The caucus is in 22 days and we need every member of @TeamJoe knocking on doors so we can win this thing! Come join @JoeForIA TODAY!! #TeamJoepictwittercom/2jTgIYw2CC.
