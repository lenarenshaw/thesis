I dont really understand what she is hoping to accomplish in the primary.
You can get even easier parallels if you look at how oda nobunaga, arguably the most popular of the sengoku generals, is interpreted: (the primary difference being that he isn't always turned pretty, but he's always romanticized a lot in that battle-hungry way) pictwittercom/kQIbCa71bA.
@BretBaier nice to have the NH primary special show today! @brithume @marthamaccallum @BillHemmer.
Same I give him great credit for bringing once-fringe ideas into mainstream Democratic discourse but I won't be voting for him in the primary this time I'm seeing shades of 2016 And I live in a blurple educated suburb; the women here are not into him at all.
This Democratic primary season has laid bare the Left's fundamental problem   There's nothing really holding them together, and they offer nothing that brings people together  That's why they're losing.
And even the results from the lily white caucus states were tainted & should’ve been discarded The primary calendar is racist & the media perpetuates this racism by over-emphasizing the importance of the results from IA & NH The elitists have dismissed & diminished the AA vote!.

Indeed It's also a myth to say the US lost the Vietnam war I mean, they didn't achieve their ultimate goal of turning it into something akin to a Latin-American terror state eg Chile But their primary goal was achieved, it crushed 'The Domino Effect' and self-determination.

Bruh it did better than a movie I didn't know or hear about, a movie where the primary attraction is changing the order of the names and lastly, a sequel of a movie that most younger people were born too late for to know Massive success.
If there is primary level turnout Bernie still wins and Pete gets crippled by a more buoyant Biden.
Until the democratic party rejects the current primary system allowing Iowa caucas and NH primary to go 1/2, national democratic wishes will never be represented in presidential elections Neither Iowa nor NH come close to representing national, Democratic, majority ideals.

I don’t think she can win the primary I do like her as a possible VP choice for Biden I think she is tough and there will be pressure for him to have a woman on the ticket I know we have to get him to win first.

Pete’s running for the wrong primary.
the primary difference for me is in tone, "fandom" feels infantalizing and representative of the unhealthy and obsessive culture that surrounds it while "fanbase" has been in use for a much longer time and carries a much more neutral tone  at least imo.
I guess we’ll just have to see who the primary voters eventually choose for their dem candidate! At least the party should have a strong unified message at the end of the primary.

Acknowledgement by Mr Trump for complicit acquittal in impeachment trial   The focus on 191 judges confirmed to the bench is a slap to the face of the American people who expect the Senate to take up legislation as their primary duty    #GOPComplicit #ImpeachedNotExonerated.
Their grand scheme started when they shut down the GOP primary because they didn't think Trump would are well against Wash and Weldon  The "meddling" consists of telling Republicans to vote for Sanders in the primary   They were hoping the Dems would go ballistic.
The fact that our choices in 2008 & 2012 were McCain and Romney, convinces me that the Republican primary system is broken Too many open primaries & voter fraud encourage liberals to help select the weakest candidate in the field Reform the primaries for success after Trump.
Once Kamala Harris exited the primary, we stopped having a viable path out of the Trump administration.
We'll be donating to @SenSanders all the way to the last vote count in this primary And do it all over again in the general.
She said it is primary focus in her dept Still, prepare for worst and hope for best I stocked up on hand sanitizer, lysol spray, masks, bleach, laundry soap Now strategizing for items that you'd need if there was a snowstorm for weeks Canned food, bottled water and such .

Iowa is a bellwether for the Midwestern Vote in general but also serves as the first state to vote in the primary, and so it is often considered important for momentums sake It is also worth noting though that it only accounts for 1% of Delegates, and thus is often overhyped.
I'm talking about mid-troposphere Direct transmission through spectral hole is shown Radiative transfer, the primary transfer,  is omitted  If you think not then give coodinates: ie 60% left, 40%up.
So what the Iowa caucus taught me this year, is that I need to move to a primary state cause I ain’t got the patience and long suffering in me to be somewhere 2 hrs trying to be a good citizen and it all be for naught.
Iowa Caucus voting issues are not a bug They are a feature Muddy the waters, then claim Bernie Sanders failed to meet expectations Bernard Sanders will ultimately have more primary voters than any other Democrat candidate The party will screw him at the convention.
I think Biden's black support is based on name recognition and electability but it is paper thin  They may abandon him I'm droves or more likely stay home in droves uninterested in the primary and just voting whoever runs against Trump.
Wow I went to primary around this bridge, it sure looks good! Not as dirty and dingy as back in the day!.

I don't think we'll have any real idea of how this primary is going until we get to a state that isn't almost completely white.

Everybody check your Vichy Democrats bingo card: if you had failed impeachment, primary election tampering, psychotic CIA-backed imperialism, meaningless performative resistance, etc, you could be a winner!.
Sounds like a primary.
But they were able to declare the winner of the entire primary before Super Tuesday last time.
Let’s hope @PeteButtigieg carries this momentum into the New Hampshire primary!! He’s more moderate and a figure who can reach out across the aisle! Let’s hope he does this! #PeteButtigieg #Pete #Buttigieg #MayorPete #Iowa #NewHampshire #Democrats.
We got Rank Choice Voting officially in Maine We fought for it by people's initiatives, took years Apparently not this primary, (last minute legislation funding issues), but going forward in the Presidential election and we already used it in 2018 for Congress and Senate.
Oh, are you going to seek to remove us from the union over this? Each state rewards delegates to the candidates during the primary season I'm sorry that the word equivalence confuses you It's just something that goes along with the quirky caucus system.

When @realDonaldTrump uses @MittRomney’s presidential campaign loss in 2012 as a way to attack his reputation or as a reason for Romney’s actions, I wonder how that makes @newtgingrich and @RickSantorum feel, since they both lost to Romney in the primary.
Modern Warfare has bloated itself to nearly 150 gigs This is ridiculous It’s primary game modes need to be broken into modular parts that can be uninstalled and reinstalled Multiplayer-only games (as a genre) generally require much less space All games usually do Jesus .
That would be super stupid on his part, as much of sanders support is independent and non voter, so he's better situated for the general than the primary, and he'll cut into trumps non shitty populist base By all means, help him overcome establishment fuckery.
Things change every 4 hours That's why No complete vote in Iowa?? What the hell?? Best to chill and wait for your primary I have my absentee ballot in hand My vote is in March Ppl will tear Bernie apartand Pete and Biden and Warren.

You're not grassroots You took a boatload of corporate cash during your Senate race and squirrled it away for this primary Can't you stop lying?.
Sounds like it's time for an actual primary in Iowa  I'm OK with the EC nationally because each state is, technically, a sovereign, however within each state I think it should be about the popular vote.
This primary seems like it will be pretty fascinating probably, and also Bernie is going to win.
Every time I hear about that particular issue as it affects POTUS elections, it seems to always contain comments about how IA does NOT reflect the Democratic electorate "across the nation" They need to get real, deep-six the caucus and go w/primary elections & paper ballots.
Keep screwing around with this primary, and you'll get four more years of Trump, and then eight of Don Jr.
A primary where a progressive may win.

Agreed And now, in my opinion, we’re paying even MORE attention to Iowa   Iowa is one state  And a very white one at that  I have wanted this primary to be over almost since it started.
Personally, I think our primary voting is ridiculous The voting should be regional on the first Tuesday of every month, Feb- June And the regions order should be rotated Nothing against #Iowa  & #NewHampshire, but why are they first EVERY time?.
It’s a problem that a state has become dependent on presidential primary elections No state should have their economy revolving around our elections Rotating who is first would solve this.
Ah yes - the results of the Kansas primary.
Changing it to a primary was indeed part of the discussion Bernie successfully blocked that Lying about your guys actions, typical Bernie bro shit.
I’m not regretting I still think that’s the best route to take We play to win therefore we played hard Iowa is nothing we still got 3 more first primary states.
Indeed And Sanders, per his own storyline of how he was leading, needs to win Iowa huge or he is done If he cannot win Iowa big vs someone to the right of Biden, where he was allegedly strong, he cannot win nationally even in the primary; much less in the general.
I voted Bernie in 2016 primary, but I am 100% on board for pete now Open your eyes people all of the top candidates are decent candidates.
This is literally how a primary works If a candidate is a complete shithead he is criticised accordingly - like when Mayo Pete describes environmental or immigrant rights groups as malicious dark money orgs (Mayo Pete, meanwhile, has ~40 billionaire backers to Bernie's zero).
I mean, they flopped a rigged primary, they are getting super sloppy.
Hillary wasn’t following Trump  The nominating process in both parties is broken  The hard core is who determines the primary winner on both sides  That results in a candidate that has to pivot back to the center for the general election    Bloomberg is the likely nominee now.
It's more complicated than that IOWANS don't want to change to a primary bc by some strange rule, if Iowa changes to a primary, they lose their place at the front of the line in the primary.

That would basically just be a primary then instead of a caucus    But then again, a caucus is essentially a primary where you get to change your vote in the next round if your guy doesn't get enough support  So primaries with run-off elections.

Hmmm, how come no one cared at the end of the 2016 primary season when Sanders received a higher share of the pledged delegates than his share of the vote?   Odd.
I dont believe this at all, this man was barely polling and somehow he win that primary yeahright.
That was huge part of his campaign against Hillary - the emails, that she rigged the primary, etc Even if the stories get debunked, he keeps saying it And some non-0% of the electorate will find it persuasive.

What I don’t understand about Bernie is that many pundits and voters are worried if he wins the primary he will have to answer for why he is a “socialist”  He’s not! And I’m not sure why he never says “im not a socialist I’m a democratic socialist which is very different”.

We agree voters deserve a system that's error free and auditable Paper primary FTW But human error is not election fraud, and the caucus did have a flaw in it's design in that inconsistencies can be unreconcilable after the fact Systems need to account for human error.

Plus, I think I would be more confident about vetting and scrutiny towards him if he were just, you know, doing the regular primary calendar Him getting in late, and Iowa not doing any winnowingit seems like we could end up with no clear consensus, but SOMEONE will win.
But I’m not for Bernie Do I have a choice not to vote for him in the primary and but hold my nose and vote for him during the general?.
And isn’t thinking someone is a “joke” literally how we got Captain Orangey McPoopPants?   Maybe the democratic tribalism needs to chill the fuck out and let literally more than one primary or caucus occur?.

Cant tell if sarcasm but literally the point of a primary is to find the best candidate are they just supposed to ignore each others flaws?.
If the DNC had any integrity, they’d never let Bernie any where near a Democratic primary.
My only point here is that we have to test these claims by making predictions about primary elections, because after the fact it's easy to find all kinds ways to rationalize the outcome.

#RecallRomney i, like many of you are disappointed in Mitt; BUT remember, we do need his votes for judges, and legislation Let's hope he can acquit himself with his future votes If not, then we primary him.

Trump let or led Romney to think he was going to be Sec of State When that didn't happen, Romney ran for senate for the primary purpose of casting this particular vote.
"DID reflects a failure to integrate various aspects of identity, memory, and consciousness into a single multidimensional self Usually, a primary identity carries the individual's given name and is passive, dependent, guilty, and depressed".
Caucuses are probably the hardest elections to cook the books on because everybody present at each caucus location knows the results because the totals are public I'd be more worried about the New Hampshire primary There is NO way statistically Hillary's crocodile tears won '08.
sources anyway And to go to the primary source I’m trained to research and to recognise bias, and I’m seeing it more in the BBC It’s a shame But that’s still irrelevant to the licensing fees There are other ways to generate funding and revenue.
The primary in Iowa takes the form of a caucus The secondary, tertiary and quaternary in Iowa also take the form of a caucus.
Romney is an institution in Utah, he has a much longer rope than your generic R in Utah  Him being the first Mormon nominee means something to mormons in that state If Trump loses, I can see him surviving his primary.

He does; he plans on taking away what little some have and going back to his cronies getting wealthier, claims being denied, people forced to use Emergency Rooms for primary care, and many more people dying because they can't access care That's his plan.
