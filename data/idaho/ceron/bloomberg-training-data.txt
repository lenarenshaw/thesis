bloomberg is 'worth' $60B  he's now poured $350M into his campaign, far outspending all other candidates COMBINED not counting the other self-funded billionaire (steyer)  $350M/$60B= 0583%  which is equivalent to someone 'worth' $100k spending $583  this is *nothing* to him.
if a candidate (bloomberg) is dropping millions of their own dollars to force their way into an election, you can bet theyve got a plan to make billions of dollars off of the presidency.

bloomberg certainly is that trump was just a buffoon before the presidency doomberg is insidious.
in 2004, michael bloomberg illegally arrested 2,000 of his political opponents and held them without bail or access to an attorney this is a not a hypothetical fear about what might happen, this is a fact of history and a likely pattern of behavior should he regain power again.
Ok let bloomberg make anti trump commercials & draw trump’s fire while the top 5 candidates continue to campaign.
the fact that u think bloomberg is likable is very telling.

im not super knowledgeable of politics, but seeing these bloomberg ads with an old white dude portraying tons of POC behind him and how he’s bettering their lives is just SUS I knew that shit was fake and manipulative before even looking him up.
NOT interested in bloomberg at all but you really believe there are no other differences between him and trump worth voting for? A lot of other people's lives are at stake too Like North Korea/Iran/Russia/China/Israel/Palestine sized problems that shouldn't be left to trump&co.
