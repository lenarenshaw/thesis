Just keep your young daughters away from him! Ask @ChrisCoons about what @JoeBiden did to his daughter! Also make sure he shows up in South Carolina for the primary & NOT South Dakota!

Actual photo of me omw to vote in the Indiana primary (May 5th) after the USA has cordoned off the Dakotas as a Corona virus contamination zone pictwittercom/abvhIu42kV.
Klobuchar literally has nowhere to go in this primary She’ll get delegates in Minnesota and *maybe* North Dakota but that’s nowhere near enough Her polling bounce is over and has receded to about 5% nationally Time for her to drop out, she’s only helping Bernie at this point.
Pete trying to take this approach as he does victory laps after each primary/caucus despite how he finishes is ridiculous https://twittercom/merica/status/1232078705582800896 ….
North Dakota is a Firehouse Caucus which is just a regular primary but run by the state party.
South Dakota's presidential primary is June 2 https://sdsosgov/elections-voting/upcoming-elections/general-information/2020-Election-Informationaspx … How to register https://sdsosgov/elections-voting/voting/register-to-vote/defaultaspx … No fighting about candidates in the neighborhood.
The good news is, there are very few Caucuses coming up Just Wyoming and some of the territories   Technically North Dakota calls there's a "firehouse caucus", but it'll act more like a party-run primary.
Biden is eagerly awaiting the election results to see if he won the Mayor of South Dakota primary today.
The South Dakota dem primary is June 2 2020 This is a joke poking at @JoeBiden ‘s stupidity Of course they meant South Carolina.
Yes, change is needed in 2022 Twelve states Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin - have open primaries (I may have missed some) but it does seem illegal for a Republican to vote in the SC primary.
The primary winner in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, Idaho, Wyoming, N Dakota, S Dakota should have delegates deducted.
I didn't vote today South Dakota's primary is June 2.
South Dakota's primary isn't until June, but I'll be casting my vote for Warren.
I'm a #PeteToBiden transfer #ThankYouPete #Soulcraft I'll be voting for Biden in the North Dakota primary #BidenForPresident #Biden2020.

Thank you, sir! I hope that I will have the opportunity to do the same when South Dakota's primary comes up in June.
If Bernie Sanders has 1991 pledged delegates, the majority number, on the first ballot at the convention, he will be the nominee Those delegates are awarded based upon caucus and primary results No super delegates vote on the first ballot.
A proposed new #DistractedDriving law in South Dakota would expand the current law to a primary offense, increasing the penalty to $500 and up to 30 days in jail http://bitly/2Vxw7LU  @pressanddakotan @DriveSafeSD.
SDs have never decided a presidential primary Never And that chance is even more remote this year with the rules changes put in place after 2016 Arguing over superdelegates when we're 4 states into the primary is weird given those facts.
vote for someone else SDs have never decided a primary election - pledged delegate majorities have always occurred - and it'll be even LONGER in the hypothetical process when they come into play this time So the issue of their influence is absolutely overdrawn 3/.
The way the convention works is that pledged delegates vote based on primary results, and then re-vote if there's no majority At that second vote, the delegates from candidates who aren't viable, or who've dropped out, or who's candidates have negotiated their release, 2/.
what was seen as "illusory" control of the nomination process by primary voters[10] A commission headed by South Dakota Senator George McGovern and Minnesota Representative Donald M Fraser met in 1969 and 1970 to make the composition of the Democratic Party's.
In #TX22 GOP primary, pro-Nehls super PAC discloses donors for first time — $75K raised Jan 1-Feb 12, $50K of it from a South Dakota retiree, per FEC filing.

I'm afraid the same thing will happen in South Dakota Who the fuck decided all the DNC primary elections should be open? That person should be fired.
And More States with Open Primaries Oklahoma (Only Democratic primary is open to Independent voters as of November 2015) [15] South Carolina South Dakota (Only Democratic primary is open to Independent voters as of November 2018) Tennessee Texas.

Biden just won his first primary after running 4 different times He just did a 6 figure add buy, hasn't been to a super Tuesday state in over a month, doesn't have anywhere close to as many donors as Bernie, and no movement behind him He also has a gaffe a day He will lose.

Amy's fine In 1992, Bill Clinton came in 4th in the Iowa caucuses, 2nd in New Hampshire, 4th in the 3rd primary in Maine, 3rd in the next in South Dakota He only won 1 state on Super Tuesday (Georgia) and didn't even come in the top 3 in 3 of the states who held primaries Mar 3.

Perdue designates 16 North Dakota counties as primary disaster areas https://tribal/K69xS0D pictwittercom/VL2M9SsETn.
Plus states like North Dakota essentially changed to a primary, from a caucus.
I’m talking about the general, but in terms of Gabbard and the primary I fail to see how supporting her is proxy for Trump She aggressively goes after his foreign policy She’s more Bernie Sanders than Donald Trump, just in a younger, healthier package.

Same for Sanders in 2016 - he was down, but he was still won a caucus in North Dakota   If we wanted someone to wrap this up quickly, we should have shortened the primary window, convention or no convention.
@HardballChris what a bunch of ahistorical bull you’re selling 1968 the Daly “mainstream” of the dem party gleefully defeated eugene McCarthy 1972 the Dems put forward 15 potential candidates in the primary South Dakota senator McGovern was no radical South Dakota!.

North Dakota may be confusing some folks as to whether it's a caucus or a primary  It's officially a "firehouse caucus" Does that mean it's a caucus, like Iowa?  No Misleading term Firehouse caucus just means "primary, but run by the state party rather than the state govt".
Bernie won Utah, Oklahoma, Idaho, North Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming, Kansas in the 2016 primary  I won't say he would win them in a GE, but our definition of red vs blue is obsolete.
I just requested a mail-in ballot for the North Dakota Democratic Primary and you can, too! https://demnplcom/primary/ .
