All I want for my birthday is a great result for @PeteButtigieg in the NH primary!.
Thank you!  She's my first choice too  Our primary isn't until May.
WAY too early for this We can’t let 375K (total) people from 2 VERY white/fairly moderate states stop us from fighting for Warren I was disappointed with the outcome too, but my primary is 3/3, she has my vote and I am knocking doors for the first time in my life this weekend!.
