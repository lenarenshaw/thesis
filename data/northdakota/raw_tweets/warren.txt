Voted for @ewarren and myself (Warren Delegate) in Alabama!! pictwittercom/88V6F4nNCB.
"The Dakota Access Pipeline presented an opportunity for Warren to save face and fight for the rights of Native Americans"  As usual, she was nowhere to be found  https://wwwgooglecom/amp/s/observercom/2016/11/sen-warren-turns-her-back-on-native-americans-after-exploiting-them/amp/ ….
Let’s see some proof on that  Also, here’s some proof you’re a hypocrite, because Warren definitely takes PAC money  https://wwwnewsweekcom/super-pacs-backing-elizabeth-warren-have-far-outspent-those-supporting-all-other-democratic-1490342 ….
Bernie will take Washington, North Dakota, Idaho and Michigan in Tuesday right? Also, it’s actually setting in that warren really may not endorse him beforehand *sigh*.
Biden voters will vote for warren but not sanders? What gave you that idea?.
Throughout the efforts to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, Senator Warren, as she did during the Democratic Primaries in her refusal to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2016, stayed on the fence to avoid any political risk #Bernie2020https://wwwcounterpunchorg/2016/12/06/elizabeth-warrens-shameful-exploitation-of-standing-rock-victory/ ….

Why do you think Biden , warren, Bloomberg or any other candidate would be able to do that? Eaten didn’t help the Dakota Indians  Biden was prove segregation when it was cool Bloomberg has more sexual assault then trump .
I'm voting for #ElizabethWarren @ewarren in the South Dakota primary.

Let me ask you what bothers native Americans more Trump calling warren Pocahontas? Or Obama using armed security to kick the shit out of Dakota pipeline protestors & run the pipeline right up their ass?  Time to show your cards.
My dog, cooper, would definitely have voted for Biden and it makes me so sad and Dakota would’ve voted for warren but I know Shiloh, the in heat 6 month old freak would’ve voted to Bernie and that’s just #hotgirIsforbernie babypictwittercom/vSU8Gj6KBo.

I’m talking about warren herself needing to endorse Bernie Her silence is deafening tbh If Bernie doesn’t get it, trump will likely win And even if Biden does, more of the same is not what we need.
