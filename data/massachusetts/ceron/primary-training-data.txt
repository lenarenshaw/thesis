A national primary and general election national holiday would be a great step as well.
@secupp agreed, @DNC and the candidates are fumbling the competition that is supposed to be a primary No one is captivating me @ewarren @BernieSanders @JoeBiden @PeteButtigieg @amyklobuchar #SaturdayThoughts #DemDebate #DemDebate2020pictwittercom/Dm4sMXc8Aw.
YesThey know he is positioned to overtake them all after the first 4 states primary/caucuses,which he did not enter because he started lateThey are treating him like a fellow candidateThey know he's starting to suck the oxygen out of the room, the he's for realTHEY'RE SCARED!.

I don’t think that Biden can win either but you best believe that I’ll be voting for him in the primary if he’s the candidate I’d hope that we would all do the same for any nominee.
The fact that billionaire candidates  bailed on IA and NH to shift their attention to NV and Super Tuesday,   tells you everything about the mess this primary has become #2020watch.
Must read from @mtaibbi — this really puts the state of the Democratic Party in perspective as we head into tomorrow’s #FITN primary https://wwwrollingstonecom/politics/politics-features/iowa-caucus-democrats-disaster-trump-sanders-949655/ ….
We are now in the phase of the democratic primary where we attack other candidates for making obviously joking statements  Congrats, Democrats  We’ve rendered Russian disinformation redundant.
It’s not ageist to be concerned about Bernie and Biden’s ability to serve The health and transparency of candidates is a serious issue Elizabeth Warren on the other hand was the first candidate to release medical records: https://wwwhuffpostcom/entry/elizabeth-warren-medical-records-democratic-primary_n_5de991b1e4b0d50f32b100dc …https://twittercom/chucktodd/status/1226542225443737602 ….
