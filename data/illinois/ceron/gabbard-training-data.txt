That's a fair point and you're right But after that we've got to Rally around whoever it is And don't worry, I know it's not going to be Tulsi gabbard Or Mike Bloomberg.
I am 100% confident that there is no way he's going to pick gabbard You will see If there are actually real living human beings that are hoping for this, I don't know what they are smoking But I think it's got to be a disinformation campaign.
I hadn't heard the gabbard rumor But to me, it doesn't pass the smell test It sounds too off.
