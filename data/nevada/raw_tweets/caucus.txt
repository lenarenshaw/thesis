Well bless 'em, because I work 2 jobs and I'm 110 years old and I'm not walking around in the snow and slush doing it! And everyone has been nice (even the girl for Bernie was cool when I said I was going to caucus for Warren) Bernie ppl not so cool texting- rude.
Warren going hard on “unity” today Other than the obvious (uniting the party is good!), a Warren aide tells me among ppl they’ve IDed as caucusing for Warren who also caucused in 16, they’re a 50/50 split b/ween those who caucused for Sanders & those who caucused for Clinton.
Over 40-degrees and dry in downtown Des Moines on the Saturday before caucus I mingled with activists and media all day  Everyone is joyful It's like a festival celebrating our system of self-governance #IowaCaucus.
I'm not much one for cocaine, so I never thought I'd find something that gave me quite the dopamine rush of a good post  Then I convinced a first time voter to caucus for Bernie.

My pet peeve is people who can't figure out farm land while flying over it  By the way, Iowa caucus turn out was LOW.
Problem is that the nomination process that is what the primaries/caucuses are a part of are dictated by the parties and  state law (at least in WA) In addition in WA we still have the primary AND caucus and it’s up to the parties which results they use.
I don’t see how he can without placing his finger on scale It’s to early 1 caucus in But when he does it’ll help stabilize things most def.
We agree voters deserve a system that's error free and auditable Paper primary FTW But human error is not election fraud, and the caucus did have a flaw in it's design in that inconsistencies can be unreconcilable after the fact Systems need to account for human error.
I called that one a few days ago Between that and the plane loads of MAGA hats being flown in to caucus IOWA, the CORRUPT REPUBLICAN PARTY just has to be up to DIRTY TRICKS with the sudden rise of Bernie’s popularity! Bet MAGA’s are going to support Bernie’s numbers so far.

Satellite caucuses in AZ and FL indicate that Klobuchar and Buttigieg are favored by older, mostly-white snowbirds Bernie? not so much This is going to be an interesting night .
And Clinton came in fourth 2 of 3 Dem presidents did not win the Iowa caucus.
I wouldn't put too much faith in Iowa as an indication on how the remainder of the primary will go  Ted Cruz won the 2016 GOP caucuses  Plus these satellite caucuses are a small representation of overall population.
"Iowa caucus locations in Florida and Arizona"  What the hell are we doing here?.
Plus turnout at a #caucus are those people that have spare time, want to debate, and can stand around a lot The participating % is teensy tiny compared to the electorate Like I said: basically meaningless.

In some of the cases yes (registered Dems out of state) -- where there are large contingents of Iowans -- but also some satellite locations within the state who can't travel to a caucus site or make the caucus time due to work obligations.
I can't stand what I'm listening to -- an hour before the caucus closes   #Bernie2020.
they are the stupidest way to select a candidate no matter how much @AriMelber tries to convince us otherwise Takes away one person one vote and if you can't get to the caucus because of work, family obligations whatever, you get no say.

Ya think? How anyone can take the 2020 Iowa caucus seriously, is beyond me.
This is a legitimate question & imo turnout at the primary is overrated I will #VoteBlueNoMatterWho & even though I have participated in every primary (and caucus!) I was eligible 2 since 18, I am not passionately behind anyone Just want to beat Trump It’s the only motivation.
Weird how that “Republican” interference benefitted only one candidate  A candidate who had shady connections to the people helping run the caucus.
Yeah Iowa caucus was a fraud Pete was dead in the water and magically got revived by the Iowa mess.

I'll bet it helped Andrew for so many voters to come out to the caucus & see the Yang support Probably half of them thought he'd dropped out, due to the media blackout They voted for someone else, but on the way home they were probably wishing they'd gone Yang on the 1st ballot.

Every time I hear about that particular issue as it affects POTUS elections, it seems to always contain comments about how IA does NOT reflect the Democratic electorate "across the nation" They need to get real, deep-six the caucus and go w/primary elections & paper ballots.
But the point is, saying we should say “bye” to Biden because of the Iowa caucuses is extremely shortsighted The tiniest, whitest demographic of the American electorate has spoken There are many primaries to go.

Just get rid of the caucus  Getting as many votes as possible and making the voting process convenient should be the goal in a true democracy  If people want to have some kind of gathering before or after the vote, then fine.

I will say, with all of the bullshit this caucus has wrought, it’s funny as fuck to see Biden just completely shit the bed.
To hack an open vote with a paper trail you literally have to persuade a majority of caucus goers to vote for the candidate you want to put in place.

True  If the network had enough contacts on the ground they could also just bypass the #CorruptDNC and their garbage APP and release preliminary results themselves Most precincts write results on a giant whiteboard at the end of the caucus #IowaCaucus.
1 Most delegates are apportioned on a precinct basis, not statewide (though there are those delegates,too) Same as in 2016 2 Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who lobbied hard after 2016 in favor of caucuses 3 The problem w/caucuses is that they’re *undemocratic* 4 .
A nonsense argument If 91% of all voters are white, and 91% of all caucus attendees were white, then it follows that white people caucused proportionately and were no more apathetic to the process than other races Why do white folks have more of a burden to vote than other races.

Just checked the results of the Iowa Caucus  It's 97%  Are they ever going to get to 100%?  So, looks like practically a tie  I much prefer Pete if I haven't expressed that   https://wwwnytimescom/interactive/2020/02/04/us/elections/results-iowa-caucushtml ….
Don't get too discouraged I talked to some people the day after the caucuses They didn't caucus because they really don't care who the Nominee is, they will vote for the Dem Hate Trump.
Yes it was post caucus.
I agree with you and Iowa caucus proves how stupid caucuses are because they exclude so many people.
Send in the clowns!

I’m looking at this as a blessing in disguise Your comment has a sarcastic tone to it, but I’m hoping this closes the case against caucuses in general and the Iowa Caucus in particular It takes a failure of this magnitude to break with entrenched tradition! .
Don't confuse a caucus with a primary  We will still have caucuses, even if we don't have presidential preferences.

I just heard they were blaming Trump for they Iowa caucus mess.
Just a quick reminder, the Bernie camapign also harassed 500,000 people throughout the month of February  They made 500,000 calls and knocked on countless doors People need to stop wondering why turnout to a caucus, where people shout at each other, was low.
Perez had nothing to do with the Iowa caucus system   If you want to be mad, be mad at Bernie Sanders, who insisted on extra steps that wound up screwing up our caucus reporting  But know that at each precinct, each campaign rep signed the vote tallies & that's what we counted.
the caucus they created, the rules they made and they still can't do it right.
Why won’t you just let us slander Bernie and rig caucus results in peace? So divisive.

WTF even is a caucus?.
@AriMelber Good for you! You understand that Iowa Caucus isn't done to provide convenient information to journalists — or candidates The caucuses are to provide a venue for discussions on candidates and issues, and to make decisions.
Te como el caucus de Iowa y lo flipas.
Even a successful caucus is a disaster.
I hope the Dems debate goes better than their Iowa caucus nightmare , check the mics and make sure the lights work! Oh and make sure Donna Brazille  isn’t there handing out questions before debate starts!;)).
Looks like 14 in the second box category are to be allocated when they go to their county or state conventions and the delegates actually elected at caucus sites to attend cast votes accordingly What a convoluted mess At every state level D party machine, probably shenanigans.

Are you referring to the #iowacaucus2020 or the impeached president ya'll let walk? Iowa certainly was unkind to your friend Senator Sanders, it's a great shot redemption for the unkind manner you've treated your friend Mr Sanders with Please clear this up ma'am #corruptpolis.
Ignorance probably  They had 1,700 caucus sites throughout Iowa to report on Tally that by the number of candidates plus the number of their votes put together Data wise we are talking couple of megabytes in data at most from one caucus site All together around 7 gigs of data.

Iowa still isn’t reporting at 100% for the caucus that was 2 days ago, such a mess, get voting machines and do away with caucuses #iowacaucases.
Every state has its own Democratic Party the @DNC has nothing to do with either a caucus or a primary The caucuses are run by the party in the states & primaries are run by the states Caucuses are antiquated Thank God the @MinnesotaDFL has gone to a primary pictwittercom/h9mN3bEn48.
It was cool, seeing all those Hispanic voters, going into Iowa caucus for the first time! And that Muslim caucus also many first timers there! We know because we saw the people out! We also have some results the older vote was down, so Bernie did bring out new voters!.
You do realize the DNC has nothing to do with the Iowa caucus, right? Iowa Dem Party is autonomous You’re yelling at the wrong person.
1/3: Let's say 60 people show up for a precinct caucus with a voting population of 2000 Sally, a big Bernie supporter, gets 19 (totalling 20) of her friends and neighbors to come with her to the caucus, Mayor Pete has 15 show up, Warren 10, Biden 8, Klobuchar 6, Yang 1.

@BretBaier Iowa STILL reporting partial results? The Iowa Democrat Party couldn't have screwed an election up more if it tried, & it's STILL getting screwed up! Don't let them off the hook for total incompetency The entire caucus system is an outdated joke!.
Occum's Razor: the simplest explanation is the most likely one The app that is funded by Buttigieg and has a family/business relationship with the campaign spiked the caucus, just as they spiked the DMR poll Hanlon's Razor has becomes the internet's "but actually".
That’s why I don’t understand why Yang supporters moved to Buttigieg or Klobuchar when huscgroup wasn’t viable at caucus stations They couldn’t be more different.
How, in any way, does this prove that the IDP & Buttigieg campaign rigged the caucuses in Pete’s favor.
Shouldn't your conscious demand you caucus with others who agree "the act [Trump] took" is "as destructive an attack on the oath of office and our Constitution as [he] can imagine"?.

I’m the source I was the designated reporter for my caucus I used the app without issue  You’re not wrong that it was the official reporting tool- but the paper is the official record of the event NOT the app, which was just for reporting.
Iowa caucus voter withdraws vote when she finds out Buttigieg is gay http://amsncom/09/en-ca/BBZFPHX?ocid=st2 …  She has the right to do so.
why can’t you post numbers from all caucus sites on a public facing webpage where the people that were actually there and in charge can see them and verify? TRANSPARENCY.
The cruelest outcome of the whole Iowa caucus is that it makes #PeteButtigieg think he stands a chance of winning anything in the rest of the states, which he doesn't.
Honestly once you figure out how the federal elections work, it’s not incredibly difficult to get the state elections The caucus system is absolutely broken though.

I went by my early voting site today (Nevada caucus), and the line was outside the building!  I will go back during the work week.
Of course, the fact that this is already a caucus to begin with is an enormous advantage to Bernie Sanders So far the rules have been heavily tilted in his favor.
I would call it voter manipulation, manipulating early voters to pick a 2nd and 3rd candidate (which does not happen to the people who go caucus in person).

On the actual caucus night, if someone shows up and registers their first preference but then leaves, their vote won’t matter Because they didn’t actually participate This makes the rule the same for early voters.
