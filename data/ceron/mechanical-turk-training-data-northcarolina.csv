"@MSNBC @HardballChris Bernie Sanders Defines Democratic Socialism, Says When The 99% Stand Up Against the 1% We Can Transform Society",northcarolina
"What movement? Yang ain't running on a progressive platform, and most of his online supporters have been attacking Sanders' people for months.",northcarolina
"I just told you that he tried to do that but couldn't. Because things are VOTED FOR, a MAJORITY rules, not just Bernie Sanders. You can look at ANY house rep's or senator's history and find them voting for acts that contain bills they do not agree with.",northcarolina
"You are correct though.  What you left off was hope that REAL Republicans would act against those Trump Republicans that have taken over the appearance of what Republicans represent.    Either way, a ONE party system is no god damned good for anyone, Democrat or Republican.",northcarolina
Fuck it! A Sanders-Williamson-Klobuchar-Yang-Gabbard ticket!  The only polycule I will ever support!,northcarolina
I cannot wait!,northcarolina
Shes voting Democrat when most of them want 3rd trimester abortions. She seems greatly Ill informed?,northcarolina
"Citi Trends, even. They STILL playing that commercial with Dem Franchize Boyz in it.",northcarolina
"they've been straight up reporting the iowa results as a buttigieg victory since tuesday, which is now much harder to do because of the AP projection. again, this obviously isn't an unalloyed positive for sanders, which is why i said ""not all bad news.""",northcarolina
Stay fight. I am in a Dem district. Winning one vote at a time! We can make the country red.,northcarolina
Did Warren supporters ask for your advice?,northcarolina
its like how in UK elections some constituencies r bigger than others. in some areas the votes for buttigieg count for more than they would in other areas. also there are arcane rules for deciding tied or narrow local votes whihc sometimes come down to rounding up or coin tosses,northcarolina
"For Sanders, quite a moment. I was with him in Iowa years ago when he drew a small crowd at the Drake diner. His strategist, months earlier, was running a comic book store. Clinton seemed inevitable and his support was fledgling, to say the least. Now he commands a movement.",northcarolina
"Joe Biden was simultaneously caucusing in Iowa, Ohio, and Idaho last night his numbers might be skewed.  #IowaCaucas",northcarolina
"The DNC rigged 2016 against Bernie. Electoral College robbed Hillary that same year. Bloomberg is trying to buy the presidency. Caucus results are often determined by coin flip.    The US is not ""democracy"".",northcarolina
He doesn't take huge sums of money from a super pac.... Bernie and Biden are the ones with Super Pacs,northcarolina
