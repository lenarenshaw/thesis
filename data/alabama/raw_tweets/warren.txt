oh hell yeah i know it seems weird to us but for a lot of normie voters, pete appears to be the new-young-change progressive, it makes sense a lot of his support would go to sanders and warren now we just need warren to drop and it becomes a clear progressive vs conservative https://twittercom/Robillard/status/1234255292088668160 ….
This assuming it’s just biden vs bernie A model with Biden vs bernie and warren probably has biden on top.
It's really sad that @ewarren has completely destroyed any respect many people including myself once held for her She was my number one for the beginning of the primary and it's sad to see her stoop so low :/.
@BernieSanders @JoeBiden @ewarren   No body buying your craps Bernie, Joe, Warren https://twittercom/TheJamaalHarris/status/1233459495206035462 ….
Yet he’s the only besides warren to push for universal healthcare, having the most diverse supporters, and not defending segregation like Biden.
he recognizes all their problems except for warren who he supports funny that.
Yeah trump is fasho going to win if warren gets the Democratic nominee.
Can't wait to see what Amy Klobuchar's burner account posts, @ashleyfeinberg https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1234266283992133632 ….
Whose fault is that The answer is insane sanders supporters They blew it up Now it wouldn’t surprise me is warren doesn’t want to help him A lot of hard feelings there.
apparently liz warren's mom also told her it was bad to take super pac money and she just took it as fact for so many years until.
But klobuchar and warren should stay in? Their best showings were 3rd place, once each.
yeah, i thought the heart attack was it -- i was 100000% sure warren was gonna take it when that happened was the main reason i didn't sell all my shares (i had nearly 100k warren shares across markets) but the exact opposite happened politics is funny, it really is.

It’s interesting that @ewarren is described as filleting Bloomberg or even ripping his stents out & @amyklobuchar is seen as so hate driven she’ll bomb Southbend There’s an underlying stereotype of the evil blood-thirsty witch as opposed to a strong woman #DemocratDebate.
Campaign finance desperately needs reform   That Bloomberg can parachute in just because of his money puts a pretty fine point on it  @ewarren should have a plan for this and make it a major part of her platform at each and every opportunity.

i was open to warren until recently, but im upset she shifted her focus to trying to get the nomination at a contested convention without getting the most delegates regardless of whether its justifiable, someone getting the nom that way will tank the dems' chances against trump.

there is in fact video from about the time period warren claimed that bernie said a woman couldn't be president in which Bernie says he thinks a woman COULD be president.

Will @ewarren , @BernieSanders condemn this  $10 Billion bc it is coming from a billionaire?   Obviously, like Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, these funds are set up to help avoid taxation It is legal If Berners want to control these funds, then change the tax policies.
Created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by 2008 returned $12 BILLION to 29 million people Proven brain trust #warren #warren2020.
So, I am undecided I was kamala, now I don’t know  Why warren over Amy? I don’t know who to choose.
Sure, even though the second choice for both Biden and warren supporters (mostly) goes to Bernie You know those two states (that Bernie won) are a small slice of the total, right? They were mostly white states (which isn't representative of his coalition).

not trusting a damn word of what you say bc the credibility of this poll was lost when you decided to not include warren, a strong contender in this race.
If dems really don’t want sanders I think there might be an attempt to prop up warren , so sanders doesn’t get delegates he needs and they can have brokered convention I Just haven’t figured out who they do want yet.
She is 3rd in delegates and they literally left her out of the poll   Let's not forget NBC's track record with burying things either  Where is Warren   Also, have you signed up to knock some doors this weekend??? http://eventselizabethwarrencom https://twittercom/JasonOverstreet/status/1229909757953114112 ….

It’s not that he’d be bad It’s that warren would be much better.
Tell him to see if warren is hiding in there.
I'll vote Elizabeth in the primary - I'd love to have Klobuchar but I think @ewarren really is the best bet going forward from this point(please delete Bernie from everything).
imagine on avait pas encore compris que warren et fayssal on niques la casserole de @mat_dmy.

When warren dared speak up against Bernierather than call out the lies and sexist attacks launched by Bernies cult, too many of you were silent Still are In fact you're now blaming her even as she has done more than any other candidate to vet Bernie.
@ewarren & @RogerLau phone calling and texting me all the time as they must be really desperate I’ll never support Warren ever and will support Amy over sneaky, not to be trusted moderate Warren Again I asked to be taken off the list, but #Warren2020 is a sad campaign.
Lol you act like warren having one is the end of the world, but Bernie having 9 is just fine Get out of here Ain’t no body got time for Bernie bro’s.
that’s why i am also certain that its warren lying about not having bitcoin and not ceo of trx.

I will vote for the best candidate to beat Trump like a drum!I only wished @HillaryClinton ran again & told  Sanders what he could go with himselfCause he did it again to @ewarren & he’s getting another pass of underhandedness which he’s supporting since he has never apologized.
He’s The Godfather of those positions warren stole His ideas than went back on them once she got owned by Amy and Pete at a debate warren is completely self serving I say this is an ex supporter of hers.

Absolutely, but I’m voting for @ewarren in the primary.
@Bloomberg @amyklobuchar @JoeBiden @ewarren @mayorpete_2020 @SenSanders @greggutfeld The President of Mexico is Andrés Manuel López Obrador Just FYI candidates In case you’re asked again.
Well they have similar policies but Bernie has heart and passion to this and the biggest movement of any candidate Bernie has had these ideas and goals all his life unlike warren.
I remember the time when we asked them to raise concern that Bernie is constantly misplaced in polls with warren, always with benefit to her.
In Warren, planning for rising sea levels https://wwwprovidencejournalcom/news/20200216/in-warren-planning-for-rising-sea-levels ….
Today I voted for @ewarren in the SC primary Of course I’d like for her to be the next president, but I doubt it’ll happen Hopefully it’ll be Bernie.
