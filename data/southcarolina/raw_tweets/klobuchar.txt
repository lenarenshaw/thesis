@GavinNewsom @DNC with the way the primaries are going Having moved the California Primary to Super Tuesday, Puts the pressure on absentee ballots as South Carolina is on February 29th @amyklobuchar @PeteButtigieg @JoeBiden @SenWarren @SenSanders @KTLAnewsdesk @KatyTurNBC.
Must dump Trump Whoever can do it I’m in the moderate lane and I like @amyklobuchar and @PeteButtigieg I think Biden has a problem even if he wins NCarolina Hillary won the black vote too but didn’t become president.
klobuchar has debate momentum; warren has debate regrets; desperate biden says buttigieg is no obama, and that he'll probably lose again but south carolina and blacks matter sanders will probably win, so second to fifth really matter and here we are, two days til new hampshire.

She spoke of starting the “entrepreneur caucus” with Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, and her ranking position on the Senate Antitrust Committee, and she targeted consolidation  - a very @amyklobuchar sentence, via @NYTnickc.
I am a brand new North Carolina Democratic primary voter and voting for @amyklobuchar this week in early voting! Best of luck to you in New Hampshire! I WAS a 40 year GOP voter until they put the greedy, misogynistic and racist trump on the ballot .
Morning Jo & MSNBC who were supportg Biden are now dumping him corporate Dems have Buttilieg & Bloombucks on standby with Kklobuchar longshot Old tactic demonize Bernie Sanders who is ahead with Latinos in Nevada Will African Americans stay with Biden in South Carolina? pictwittercom/a4bfRa0Qma.
Nevada highlighted Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar’s weakness with African American voters  The state’s entrance polls hint at how the two could do in South Carolina  https://wwwvoxcom/2020/2/23/21149365/nevada-caucuses-pete-buttigieg-amy-klobuchar-african-american-voters-entrance-polls?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … via @voxdotcom.
steyer might get taken seriously for a second if he beats out biden in south carolina and/or nevada, where hes doing much better than anyone else but i doubt he has much of any support elsehwere similar to pete and klobuchars likited appeal outside the first two states.
@amyklobuchar Was at 4 or 5 Before this poll now she's at 7 And if she goes up a couple of points every few days She'll be at 10 or 12% surpassing mayor Pete in Warren maybe even If Klobuchar comes And I had a warrant in South Carolina and Nevada Warren will have to drop out.
nevada is nice, but i am really looking forward to south carolina that will decide everything for klobuchar and biden i hope biden does good, but if he does not finish first or 2nd, he should really drop out, so he can continue not to split the moderate vote.
i'm back  i'm not entirely sure at this point but i think amy klobuchar won the latest debate in south carolina.
@amyklobuchar I live in North Carolina and my primary vote is going to @amyklobuchar my wife is voting the for her as well LETS GO AMY!!!.

If Amy klobuchar could have a great standing in South Carolina and with black voters in general (I don't know if that's possible) , other moderate Democrats should drop out They need to be unified against Bernie.
