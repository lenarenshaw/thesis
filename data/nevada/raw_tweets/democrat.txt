What I don’t understand about Bernie is that many pundits and voters are worried if he wins the primary he will have to answer for why he is a “socialist”  He’s not! And I’m not sure why he never says “im not a socialist I’m a democratic socialist which is very different”.
He already did that His dad’s always been a democrat but ran as a republican because fox (and because he figures republics are stupid).

"Somebody supporting a Republican receiving a Democratic endorsement is certainly a flaw, yes"  My friend, that is what you call a complete failure of an institution Literally, the only job is to endorse a democrat for the primary, and they can't even do that Please do better.

Eh, I dunno, it may have been good for Buttigieg but it humiliated the democrats and cost them a lot of trust with some of their most-on-the fence voters That means if by some off chance Buttigieg wins, he just ensured he gets creamed by Trump.

you need to understand that the DNC is both incompetent and corrupt, while most democratic candidates also are not bernie, not yang, not tulsi the rest sure is though!.
1 Most delegates are apportioned on a precinct basis, not statewide (though there are those delegates,too) Same as in 2016 2 Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who lobbied hard after 2016 in favor of caucuses 3 The problem w/caucuses is that they’re *undemocratic* 4 .
D stands for DOUBLE STANDARD not democrat.
But here's the honest truth of it MOST of what Trump's policy has been isn't that different than what a moderate democrat would have run on only 10 years ago So I really think that's where your moderate blue and independents will cast their vote.
Inspires me to never vote democrat.
Any “democrat” who supports Bloomberg is as racist as trump and his supporters.

One could say these comments are only in the twitter, but when I went around Portland Oregon, last summer, 30% would vote for Trump, 30% for the "democrat" and 60% were still undecided However of those voting for Trump, none would vote for Sanders, but would consider Tulsi.

So you have no idea how to answer these questions?  Why did democrats choose 7 white people out of a field of 21?    How is Tom Steyer - fossil fuel billionaire more qualified than Senators Booker & Sanders?  Why is the Warren campaign bullying minorities?.
This is actually a question for Warren https://wwwbloombergcom/news/articles/2020-02-06/democrats-write-to-powell-for-answers-about-fed-s-repo-actions ….
the term used to be "smoke-filled back room" and the 1968 democratic primary was by no means the only time that's happened.
Social democracy is a capitalist system; it’s what Warren is talking about too The Nordic model, which is what Sanders is largely pushing, is social democracy, even though Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.
Bishop ? Really ?Are U like sharpton and jackson getting “Paid” to keep them down and get that guaranteed , modern day slavery Democrat vote? Sorry, I know this sounds awful, but independent thinking&prosperity is happening with minorities which doesn’t benefit you or democrats.
hillary and bernie were the only viable candidates in 2016 and you know it  she and the democratic establishment have been very open about how they cleared the field of any actual competition until bernie stepped in even warren got told to stay out and (unfortunately) obeyed.
That’s some real diarrhea of the mouth right there Obviously you didn’t see last night’s democrat debate That was real paganism on display If you didn’t hate Trump so much you’d see it I’m sticking with the patriotic and most prolife president we ever had Keep your globalism.
no it's not an all time highactually it ranks about 7thand the previous successes were when a  democrat was in office FACTS MATTER !.
I didn’t say he was a democrat, and I can tell you right now if Bernie ran third party Trump would get elected again.
We can only hope Bernie wins the democrat nomination and is crushed by Trump.
I will vote for literally any democratic nominee, but a Warren-Castro ticket would be very high on my list.
You hit the nail on the head Mr Richard D Phillips the democrat party has been exposed for who  they really are and the American people have woken to this fact Trump will win re-election the democrat liberal party is the reason will be re-elected.

Please do no support one racist over another Bloomberg is a career repulican who switched to democrat for the optics He's a racist He won't win against Trump.
@NBCPolitics This CORRUPT president spent the entire state of the union address mocking,branding, & Blasting the democrats for "Socialism" (& everybody KNOWS he was talking bout SANDERS; So now that the 1 he's Really Afraid of (BLOOMBERG) is rocketing up the polls, we're s'posed.
I don't care about these labels I said the democratic base African Americans, women, youth are all big parts of the D's base Bloomberg, Biden and Sanders have a big problem significant problem with at least one of those segment of voters If that's the case D's lose.
Because the Plutes are absolutely terrified of her  Because she will kick their fucking asses, dust off FDRs regs, etc  They love them some sanders though because they know he has no shot of winning this election and he will erase democratic gains up and down ballot.

Bernie isn't a democrat.
Now that we’ve see the repercussions of that, can we assume ALL democrats will vote against Trump, no matter the nominee If not, we deserve Trump  So if that’s the case, shouldn’t we be focused on middle-of-the-road voters who voted for Trump, but would swing to a moderate dem?.

Have you heard of the civil rights movement Neera (neera to a republican than a democrat)? that’s the plan.
Using 60% voting in favor on the Dem side and 30% on the Rep side, you would need over 67% of senate as democrats to be able to pass it with a simple majority (67 dems at 60% = 40, 33 reps at 30% = 10)  Republican support also tends to "rally" around the majority, so #MATH ??.
