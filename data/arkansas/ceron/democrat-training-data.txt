Until the democratic party rejects the current primary system allowing Iowa caucas and NH primary to go 1/2, national democratic wishes will never be represented in presidential elections Neither Iowa nor NH come close to representing national, Democratic, majority ideals.
Not to mention even with a horrible centrist democrat, you can still criticize them without having them subvert reality and brush everything off to the point where nothing matters anymore Trump tells quantifiably harmful lies every 2 seconds and keeps getting away with it.

What I don’t understand about Bernie is that many pundits and voters are worried if he wins the primary he will have to answer for why he is a “socialist”  He’s not! And I’m not sure why he never says “im not a socialist I’m a democratic socialist which is very different”.
He already did that His dad’s always been a democrat but ran as a republican because fox (and because he figures republics are stupid).
He’s not a democrat Drink.
He should just identify as a democrat and he'd get off with time servedjust go ahead and transition!  Transdemo.

the primaries are only a contest among democrats (28%) the finals are the entire country  not the same demographics at all  the national polls always showed Sanders 10 pts ahead of Trump and Clinton  not that complicated.

Yeah right fuck this independent thought process What a president says or does should not be questioned? Keep that thought for the next democrat with a desire for revenge that goes after the trump family All's fair in love and war? God help America.
Maybe so, but a bernie/warren third party ticket will destroy the democrats now if yhey can get on the ballot in OR, WA, and CA.
So the only way those opposing democrat congress could get rid of Donald Trump while he is in office, they would have to plot an assassination or a coup on him, but that would be very corrupted if some of those opposing democrats would try that.

So impeached quite literally means nothing, especially if the house is majorly democrat.
Well the way the democratic party is demoralizing voters, rigging this primary and taking all of the bribes from Bloomberg, the GOP won't need black votes because young black voters won't be voting in November.
