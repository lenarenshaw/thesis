Translation: The Dems caucus is rascist.
Iowa should not be the first, and the caucus model is stupid.
IMO it can’t You don’t send a plumber when the dam is breaking You don’t take a garden hose to a forest fire  The LIES and actions of this president are so beyond normal and are NOT given enough attention by MSM  Today they are criticizing the Iowa caucus  SMDH  #GOPCoverup.
