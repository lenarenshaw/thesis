What did burisma get out of joe Biden besides getting the prosecutor fired ,utah
"With the incredible show of competence by this President, and the equally incredible lack of competence displayed by the #Democrat party leadership, #Trump2020 is a given. So today, supporters of @realDonaldTrump should work to get #Trump2024 trending. I'm game...are you? RETWEET",utah
Biden just called a woman voter at a rally in NH a dog face pony soldier liar. Biden is a sexist & needs to go.,utah
"I'm sorry, but if its Bloomberg vs. Trump, you should vote for Bloomberg.  Priority 1 has to be stopping fascism.",utah
The filthy rich that run the media don't like Senator Warren because she WILL hold Wall St. and their ilk to account and they won't promote THAT!,utah
I think they mean unaffiliated with a political party? Bc he's independent? But he runs as a Democrat abd caucuses with them soooo,utah
Yes. Dems let crooks go free and hassle law-abiding citizens.  If you're a Dem you get a wink and a nod. That's weaponized government against the people. We see a lot of that lately.,utah
True socialism is nowhere near. No one is talking about it.   Responsible capitalism is what Bernie and warren are pushing.,utah
@RonJohnsonWI is a 2 faced lying sob he wrote a letter to the government of Ukraine in support of @JoeBiden in 2016 signed by 6 other senators @RonJohnsonWI office is now investigating joe biden on the Ukraine deal knowing there was nothing sinister going on lying sack of shit,utah
31st NOT 1st. That's it for Iowa. No more going first in the Dem primaries/caucuses. No more skewing the electoral process toward an non-representative population. Iowa needs to vote 31st in line- which is their ranking in population in the US. Enough is enough. #31stNOT1stpic.twitter.com/QQvScmOrQW,utah
"I cry foul, I know for sure John Yang gots some votes",utah
"He's proposing Medicare for anyone who wants it, so if he wins you can still have healthcare. (I'm actually supporting Warren, but I think both of their healthcare plans are a major step in the right direction).",utah
"Nothing new, just DNC trying to rig the elections for an establishment Dem again. :)",utah
Trump is undermining every Democrat he can. Any little problem he makes a big deal out of it. He needs to mind his own business.   HE things he is king of EVERYBODY!!! HE IS federal and is sticking his nose in state BUSINESS.  He must stop now!! HE has no boundaries,utah
"Same. Until Iowa happened, I thought Biden would be the most practical choice. However, very poor performance in Iowa and his ever increasing bitterness and anger in the face of a stiff competition makes me wonder whether he can pull it off against Trump in the general election.",utah
