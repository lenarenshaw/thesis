So Biden’s caucus folks decide to go with Pete to hure Bernie’s chances weird process #NotABernieFanButThisAppearsOdd.
Okay - The caucus process seems to be very outdated.
Tonight’s #IowaCaucuses shows one thing If @JoeBiden is nominee @realDonaldTrump will beat him as college kids will stay home #SouthCarolina caucus will show how blacks view things Key to @TheDemocrats winning is maximizing voter turnout amongst ALL groups @SteveKornacki.
They DID have 2 smaller earlier caucuses for some of those who were unable, for various reasons, to attend the actual evening caucus    But I agree that the caucus process is pretty much outdated and should be replaced w better options.
