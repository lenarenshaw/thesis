This is politics, not play-doh at pre-k She had a chance to endorse sanders in ‘16 She didn’t because she wanted a cabinet position It’s politics, it’s a dirty game.
or trump got exactly what he wanted, weakening biden and getting sanders as the dem nominee.
the warren campaign's starting point is the sanders campaign's worst case scenario this is such a bad faith reading and just another example of why the media has such low public trust.
