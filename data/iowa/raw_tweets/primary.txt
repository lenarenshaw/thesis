I will enthusiastically support whoever is our Democratic nominee My primary vote is going to #Warren Because she's #smart She's #kind World leaders and troops respect her #ethics #integrity #consumerprotection #health #climate #nationalsecurity #planforthat #AllOfUs4Warren.
Amy Klobuchar: Bernie Sanders shouldn't "be leading the ticket" https://wwwaxioscom/klobuchar-bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-election-ebae634e-2321-4417-92d1-ab1f377bca57html … @amyklobuchar is flat out lying! DNC/DCCC well-known primary rigging in 2016 Amy the prosecutor who never prosecuted police for their crimes in Minnesota, that’s disqualifying! @RealTimBlack.
Oh, bosh The election was decided in the electoral college Hillary won the popular vote by millions and beat Sanders by millions in the primary Trump didn't touch him then and he's not doing so now Isn't that interesting? #MorningJoe.
We must be on the lookout for this now! None of 2016 primary DCCC Neera Tanden/Debbie Wasserman Schultz/CNN interference was ever addressed If we don’t believe that the establishment DNC/DCCC Is not working overtime we’re out of our minds https://twittercom/Ellahbie/status/1221607103506395138 ….
Wouldn’t work But why not have the first caucus/primary in a diverse state that actually represents America? And I’m an Iowan-love the attentionbut we don’t deserve it.
I love the attention, but Iowa shouldn’t be firstor certainly not always And we should just have a primary.
It’s time for AZ to replace @SenMcSallyAZ that person that was not voted for by the citizens of AZ In fact lost her primary.
Democrats and Republicans caucus very differently in Iowa And, the Democrats have made tweaks to its process Brush up on everything you'll need to know for Monday night https://wwwdesmoinesregistercom/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/08/30/iowa-caucus-how-democratic-republican-caucuses-work-differences-presidential-preferences-primary/2164118001/ ….
Caucas and primary season perhaps.
One of the first three primary’s for Democrats should be a diverse state Just sayin.
They have already cancelled the GOP primary in many states.
She has never won a majority of votes in her 3 Senate races she lost the Republican primary in 2010 and won the senate seat as a write in  She does not speak nor represent the majority of Alaskans https://twittercom/shannynmoore/status/1223341596340408320 ….
We saved the country from a Palin clone who beat her in the primary  Democrats and Independents supported her write in campaign  Looks like it wasn’t worth it in the long run.
@lisamurkowski  Lisa Murkowski has never won a majority of votes in her three Senate races  She even lost her primary in 2010, and then managed to win as a write in vote  She is is a disgrace and a coward  She does speak for the majority of Alaskans  I will not forget Lisa.
She lost in the primary She had bipartisan support It's over https://twittercom/fprefect6/status/1223317932895129600 ….
LMFAO if you needed a reason NOT to caucus and primary for Berniehere ya go! Kev here wants him to be the nomineenow why would that be? https://twittercom/GOPLeader/status/1223317784299438080 ….
She had her name written on the ballot She had lost the primary There will be no such support next time https://twittercom/redsteeze/status/1223313528854966273 ….
You won't make it through your primary https://twittercom/KimberlyforIowa/status/1223277818760646656 ….
People not having kids is a primary problem because it simultaneously breaks down pyramidal economic/social benefit structures while making more people depend on these same structures  A world of homeless older people is in our future It's only a question of how bad it gets https://twittercom/Vincent36591861/status/1223282583334723586 ….
Population growth isn't primary problem It's corrupted governance & information systems We could graze huge amounts of Africa & farm huge amounts of bivalaves all over the world with a net win for environment and human health/nutrition But instead we push soy & fake meat https://twittercom/AlephAnon/status/1223243909830184967 ….

This is YUGE exciting news a couple days before the Iowa primary   Bernie Sanders has taken the lead nationally in new NBC/WSJ poll   Bernie - 27%  Biden - 26% https://wwwnbcnewscom/politics/2020-election/sanders-biden-are-neck-neck-new-nbc-wsj-national-poll-n1127051 ….
1)That video sounds convincing, but I personally doubt it would play out that way The primary reason the American Revolution was successful was due to the existence of an actual Militia The true Constitutional Militia was destroyed with the 1903 Dick Act.
It’s harder to access and interpret, but seeking out primary sources, statistics, and documents is worth your time If it’s an event that has occurred, watching raw footage of that event is best If it’s something a political figure said, find evidence of that.
To avoid Trump-endorsed primary challengers They're counting on a fire-breathing MAGA base to secure their re-elections Undying loyalty to Trump is their only option A fair impeachment trial ain't worth upsetting a bloodthirsty, vicious GOP base.
When Logan got laid off from Deere’s our COBRA quote was 1,000!  Tell me how tf a family is supposed to pay that much for insurance when the primary earner LOST HIS JOB.
Exactly!  The caucus process is complicated, confusing, and just try doing caucus math sometime   I support a primary like other states One person, one vote.

This is AMAZING!  New poll from Texas has Bernie Sanders 2% away from Joe Biden With Bernie's momentum it's possible by TX primary (3/3) he could be leading especially if he wins IA, NH, NV, CA   Biden 28% Sanders 26% Warren 13% Bloomberg 9% Buttigieg 6% https://wwwhoustonchroniclecom/news/politics/texas/article/Bernie-Sanders-surging-in-Texas-three-weeks-15013485php ….
She knows she’s boxed out of the left lane in the primary, so this is her tacking right to try to pick off some #Resistance libs who might be looking at Bootygeek or Biden.
I tell you what, when Dems stop fast tracking oil pipelines, Trump federal judge nominations, and approving gigantic defense bills, then maybe I will start to trust them Until that point, I will work to primary them for actual progressives.
I hate the idea of a caucus As a recovering journalist it is hard for me to admit that I can go someplace and share my political opinion A primary would be so much better.
I've tried to gently offer constructive feedback that #votebluenomatterwho is as alienating now as it was in 2016, but they just get super defensive and blame me for for everything that happened in 2016 I'm not the one who rigged the primary!.
She should primary Trump!.
I could run against you and win the general  election and I’m not smart and borderline alcoholic  Oh wait, that’s everyone in your primary.
As an Alaskan she never actually stands for anything Flip flops constantly She actually lost the primary and then ran as an independent Then switched again Never seems to have Alaskan interests at heart Just her own.
and raised the issue of primarying him for betraying the people who put him in the WH I think Bernie had Warren in mind as a primary challenger It was more a threat to bring Obama in line than any actual action 2/2.
This is great for Bernie I hope it comes in the debate stage and Bernie tells the people that Biden led the efforts to cut SS under the Obama admin Bernie stopped it and that's why wanted to primary him It'll get old voters to come to Bernie.

Her primary challenger, Theresa Greenfield, would've beaten David Young, had her campaign adviser not screwed her Greenfield is now running for senate and has a lot of support Ernst was fortunate enough to run against Bruce Braley last time, who ran a terrible campaign.
Bernie Sanders has surged into a CLEAR lead in Calif This is his widest margin yet because it's outside the margin of error   Cue the centrist freakout and slurs   There are 416 pledged delegates at stake in CA, and it's not a winner take all state   http://latimescom/politics/story/2020-01-28/bernie-sanders-grabs-lead-in-california-presidential-primary …pictwittercom/GjIGq03hl2.
@SenJoniErnst @hinsonashley Why was @AGPamBondi testimony yesterday not shown on local Iowa TV channels?? Essentially this would end Biden's primary run in Iowa and elsewhere!!!.
I believe Bernie won the 2016 Oklahoma primary, so he can win anywhere.
Yes yes the reflection, but it’s the vivid primary colors against the snow!.
CALIFORNIA VOTERS!! If you're voting in the primary (and you should), bear this in mind: https://twittercom/trekkerteach12/status/1221476889732075520 ….
California's entertainment industry is full of active campaign contributors lining up behind their candidates of choice in the 2020 primary http://rssfeedsdesmoinesregistercom/~/617252432/0/desmoines/iowacaucus~Scarlett-Johansson-John-Legend-Mark-Ruffalo-Which-presidential-candidates-have-Hollywood-star-support/ ….
You mean #Unity like HRC Who has smeared candidates running in this primary, “Tulsi Gabbard Russian asset“ “nobody likes Bernie“ Then goes on sleazebag talk show host Howard stern to lie about Bernie Do you know Howard the one with naked women and Donald J Trump #Hypocrisypictwittercom/yxY75hCkYk.
Our point exactly HRC is not running for office yet she’s using her class status & white female privilege to insert herself into the primary Smearing Tulsi Gabbard as “a Russian asset“ “No one likes Bernie” Bernie has broken all records for most support & small $ Donations.
Hypocrisy to ask Bernie about congresswoman Rashida Tlalib booing HRC, Yet sees no integrity ask HRC why she has consistently been smearing candidates running in the primary Tulsi Gabbard “Russian agent” Bernie “nobody likes him” #Unity @RealTimBlack @krystalball @briebriejoyhttps://twittercom/madeleinerivera/status/1223667055020343298 ….
I think it’s funny that Kerry has the hubris to think he’s the savior or that he could win the primary Jump right in with Deval Patrick John .
I want a primary that I can cast a vote in either in person or by absentee ballot Standing in a gymnasium for hours with a bunch of other people seems very antiquated Having the 1st two states be ones that lack diversity is terrible as well I say this as an Iowan.
Seriously, it's the young volunteers who have been working non-stop here in Iowa and around the country who are the heroes I'm just a crabby old postal worker who would rather vote in a primary than dick around with a caucus.
"IF" Mittens runs it will be with the financial aid from wealthy antitrumpers & the DNC There will be a major push in open primary states to have Demoncrats cross party lines to Vote Against Trump in the primaries, in their minds this is a legitimate measure to destroy Trump ASAP.
Thanks for having our back, @SCforWarren! We’re in this fight together, and we’re so excited to watch you outwork, out-organize, and outlast through your primary #LFGhttps://twittercom/SCforWarren/status/1223988196750524416 ….
We don't have to answer that question before the primary season is over Why would I have a defeatist attitude and even contemplate Bernie losing? He won't lose You asked a question I answered it I don't want a back-and-forth Respond and I'll block and report you.

There are four months left in the primary, friend! I’m eager for early state results If Yang isn’t viable I’ll go back to being dejectedly apolitical Best of luck to you all.
What do you call Hillary poking her nose into the primary days before Iowa to shit on a candidate unsolicited?.
What do you call Hillary's comments and intervention in this primary?.
Bernie and Tulsi are the only ones that won't govern similar to @BarackObama/@realDonaldTrump If they don't win the @TheDemocrats primary I'll vote @GreenPartyUS that way they get more funding next election cycle.
This is disgusting an absolute hit piece This from the establishment Democrats that brought us Trump Do we have amnesia about Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Neera Tanden,Donna Brazile, CNN rigging 16 primary? No one prosecuted for electoral fraud! @MMFlint @BethLynch2020 @Bill_Owenhttps://twittercom/flythaimma/status/1223966766113665025 ….
We all know that they did that in 2016 with the California primary In Iowa they always count pull county first because it has the highest population and then announce the winner based upon centrist Rich Polk county I'm not effing using their app.
I’m a CA girl in AK, and I voted in caucus here in 2016, and spoke with friends in CA the day of their primary Sanders was the most electable Democrat in 2016, and he may still be We need to elect Blue regardless This is absolutely about the Supreme Court 1/.
Serious people in the GOP primary lol.
The caucus is such a sh**show Canvased today and nearly every person - planning to caucus or not - said they don't like it and would prefer a primary type vote.
I'm a mental health expert If I see signs of a cult, I will point it out He's better than tRump so I will vote for him if he wins the primary But I'm not liking what I see.
This is so very very spot on I too like berniebut I’m realistic about his chances in the general Do NoT mistake primary energy for something that will help him win in November I’m glad bernie’s voice is out therebut he can’t win the oval https://twittercom/musicwriter561/status/1223668663934496769 ….
Rumblings of the DNC reinstating superdelegates in the first round of voting for a repeat of HRC's 2016 sham primary may also have been a factor Maybe DNC changing the debate rules to favor Bloomberg also added to the tensions Can't dismantle the status quo while upholding it! https://twittercom/nataliesurely/status/1223641494713708544 ….
The Iowa caucus - first caucus or primary - is Monday, Feb 3   I wish more of the candidates had stayed in until then because I really wanted to vote for Camala Harris    But after Monday - there will be fewer people running.
Nah You probably voted both Bushes, McCain, & Romney and would do it again I did & wouldn't My primary vote would have much different.
A lot of people are forgetting that the dem establishment tried really hard to make sure Rashida did not win the primary and is gearing up for another primary run.
Why is Hillary being so divisive during the primary? Other than to shill for a shitty documentary about herself.
You supporting anyone in the dem primary? Just curious All my fav comedians are supporting my candidate.
No, Lisa actually Lost the last primary but due to a corrupt write in election ( State Election Board) she got her seat back I do think we will get rid of this Rino during the next time her term is up! Alaskan’s are not happy with her! .
Population growth isn't the primary problem The breakdown of middle class & corruption of governance/information/education is the primary problem  A large, healthy, educated/informed middle class will naturally appreciate things like quality food and protecting the environment https://twittercom/Vincent36591861/status/1223282583334723586 ….
