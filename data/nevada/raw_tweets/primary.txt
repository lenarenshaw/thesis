I will when she is running  Bernie literally needs all the votes he can get to win the primary and then the election  This was an unforced error.
You are a sad shell of the man that I supported in the primary last year #nomorefauxgressives.
I honestly don’t give a shit what Hillary thinks because she’s not running She certainly doesn’t have to support him and he acted like a spoiled brat in the 2016 primary so I can see why she doesn’t Is what she’s doing helpful? Probably not, but he needs her supportersshe does.
In the primary, I think it's reasonable to expect everyone hates Trump So, I see focusing on Trump in the primary is to avoid talking about policy  In the general, I would expect someone like Warren to use Trump policies as a foil to push her own.
Also – "male privilege?" I acknowledge I have a great deal of it (being white, male and straight) but Sanders has the most support from women out of any of the primary candidates Not sure how it applies here.
She lost because of Putin that’s what your still going with  not that she had major flaws some earned some made up??  Whoever your voting for in the primary I hope they lose cause Democrat’s like you  are the reason the Dem’s stay losing! #blamegame #crywolf #putinsfault.

I usually do the primary when it comes to a pinch point, but I was going up hill and it's a fast road I've done a report, so I shall wait with  anticipation.
Kennedy Catholics are as plentiful as Liberal Republicans like Lowell Weicker It is like trying to win the Democratic primary with white working class males instead of building on the base the Democratic has but takes for granted in favor of the Rogans/Orfs of the world.
I respect your opinion but the primary is a time for spirited debate to differentiate the candidate's ideas and policy proposals Also, this thing is going to get super ugly during the general election Dems need to get used to taking off the gloves and competing vigorously.
Sometimes I overdo it with second guessing, etc, but a point made over and over again is I don’t think anyone has a good handle on likely age distribution of Dem primary voters Instincts would say young are energized to turn out big for Sanders, but we’ll have to see next week.
The #Berners are running scared Internal polling must be telling them he's about to crash and burn in another primary and they'll have no one to blame this time.

You are not missing anything The right has spent 30 years lying about the EU and it has payed off Immigration seems to be the primary motivation, but the truth is that any EU immigrants can be kicked out of the country if they are unemployed after 3 months Immigrants from  ->.
I’m indifferent to people who have intersecting opinions from my own  Where I take issue is when people give Clinton a pass for besmearing one of the frontrunners during a primary and not promising to #voteblue is he wins, then turn around and call Sanders divisive.
I haven't liked him since 2016 , because I didn't think he gave Hillary the amount of support he could have and should have  Why did Bernie believe Hillary had to negotiate with Bernie after Hillary had eliminated him from the 2016 primary ?

It’s the primary So, no, they were not supporting him But, if he wins enough votes, he’ll need their support in the general Instead of tearing people down for not voting for him, his supporters need to share why they are voting for him Nothing more or less than that.
Why has Sami got his primary photo as his Avi tho .
Here's some truth Trump got TWICE as many votes running as incumbent in the New Hampshire primary in 2020, than Obama did doing the same thing in 2012 People LOVE President Trump, and recognize his many accomplishments The excitement is palpable Can't say that about ANY Dem.
If Bernie winning the primary solves our problems you’re right If it doesn’t you need more than that.

But we won’t beat the republican billionaire with the other republican billionaire That’s what the primary is there to prevent.
Agreed For the primary We may have to hold our nose & vote for the party nominee, so they can win, bc the alternative is frightening, more consequential then pouting bc ur candidate who's closest to your values isn't on the ticket #FlipTheSenate #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica.
Thank you  I honestly am thinking at this point the primary is Sander’s to lose Not the time for missteps in my humble opinion Little things can turn into big issues quickly at this stage of the game.
Chris, you skipped a few steps a few debates, a primary and a general election.
That’s why a Communist is leading the DNC primary.
The primary or the general?.
I am always itchy from O, so wasn't surprised to be itchy with injection! I did not flare, this was a regularly scheduled treatment, just with injection vs infusion because my neuro is the primary investigator, and I never say no to research! Steroid was ORAL.

damn you got me, no one ever gets their account banned or says the word elect in an election  bernie is  the only one with a block who won't vote blue no matter who if you try to get someone else to win the primary, it proves you want a weaker candidate vs trump.
You honestly think him threatening a primary to stop this makes him look bad?  https://wwwthenationcom/article/archive/yes-bernie-sanders-wanted-obama-primaried-in-2012-heres-why/ …pictwittercom/yvG3VoMLg9.
Bloomberg of course is highly problematic choice for primary But this "voting Bloomberg in general election = normalizing Trump" line is ridiculous on so many levels that idk where to start As if handing 4 more years to Trump & letting him harm way more ppl is morally laudable.
"There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them".

I was a lifelong Independent until last week Officially changed to Democrat so I could vote against bernie sanders in the primary.
My only issue is that he said he was going to release them, and now he isn’t The breaking the promise is problematic, but I don’t like the standard it would set I’m not going to vote for him in the primary anyway, so it’s not like that’s the dealbreaker.
Found my primary school homework folder, and this stuff is genuinely too funny to not share .
Everything they tell you is BULLSHIT  Unless Bernie wins the primary, democrats have NO CHANCE of defeating Trump.

Maybe a state that’s actually at play for democrats in the general election? We dump all this time, money and energy into Iowa for the primary and it’s not even a state that democrats have a chance of beating Rs in the general.
It’s a primary, dude.

Don't fear, just get behind Bernie He was the only one who couldn't have beaten trump in 2016 and the DNC blew it They had to corrupt the primary This time, it's either the one who can beat trump or four more years of trump It's a choice we all must make! I choose #Bernie.
They're going to primary in four years.
At least they’re voting in the dem primary  (In all seriousness tho that sucks).

hillary actually wanted trump to win the primary too  didn't go too well and he's talking behind the scenes that "socialism" isn't easy to beat  i think bernie might be the only one capable of putting up a fight in the general, the rest of them are bad against him.
Easily the funniest moment of the primary so far has been when Chris Matthews made up the 100% arbitrary “only vote for someone that would save you from a car” standard and then just said Bernie didn’t pass his fictional test  The next day we find out he did save someone.

Correct The primary goal has to be making sure the Dem nominee does not rile up the Trump base and flip Independents to him.
Seems like the inverse of what (at least some of) his supporters said 4 years ago, which was essentially "we're going to do what we can in the primary to make him the nominee, then rally around Clinton in the general if she wins" Now we all need to get behind him immediately?.
Our moral system is a mishmash of primary, secondary and tertiary values and indicators In the confusion this creates, non-primary values can be elevated into primary status This isn't ideal, but it is understandable (Realizing now this is a bit of a tangent wrt your tweet).

I admire you Pete, stay strong on the campaign trail! I haven't chosen who I am voting for in the upcoming Illinois primary, but you are an appealing candidate and running a great campaign.
I am frequently to be found in loyal opposition to my party’s leadership (data for primary challengers!) but I have been appreciating the skilled, moral, transparent work of @benwikler this cycle and I’m deeply grateful we have him in Wisconsinhttps://twittercom/benwikler/status/1227441646859583489 ….
I'm not freaking out about the Dem campaign  We're working thru the primary process, the winnowing  Recall the GOP primaries: 20+ candidates, debates with a 'kids table', name-calling, histrionics  We'll be fine and will unite  I have faith in us.
If you wanted Democratic voters to tune out of the primary at this point, this is how you’d do it.
I don’t see the point of priv primary school.
She has a looong shot at NH But that one Bernie will win it Then the real primary starts in Nevada.
Agree, particularly since the primary rule change.
You're not grassroots You took a boatload of corporate cash during your Senate race and squirrled it away for this primary Can't you stop lying?.
Sounds like it's time for an actual primary in Iowa  I'm OK with the EC nationally because each state is, technically, a sovereign, however within each state I think it should be about the popular vote.
This primary seems like it will be pretty fascinating probably, and also Bernie is going to win.
Every time I hear about that particular issue as it affects POTUS elections, it seems to always contain comments about how IA does NOT reflect the Democratic electorate "across the nation" They need to get real, deep-six the caucus and go w/primary elections & paper ballots.
Keep screwing around with this primary, and you'll get four more years of Trump, and then eight of Don Jr.
A primary where a progressive may win.
Lifelong Democrat a never Trumper since 1976 son of a Rosie the Riveter, my dad was an Navy Air corps pilot and I am a RINO! FL has a closed primary I vote against Trump ×2.
He was flaming him months ago already Brah#SneakyPete was one of the super delegates that rigged the 2016 primary for Hillary The guys record is terrible, he's a whole fucking psycho too.
@realDonaldTrump how did Mini Mike do in the Iowa primary? He's going to need a bigger box.
You clearly don’t know much about the nominating process We should abolish caucuses Or at least change the way we do them to make them more like a primary.

@JohnKingCNN Stop pretending primary results in counties Trump won in 2016 means anything Primary/general electorates are night/day Working campaigns in NYS, I learned that the more conservative a county, the more liberal its Dems Why? B/cuz only the liberals bother to be Dems.
Seems that Bernie supporters don't understand this thing called sports In sports the team who gets the most points wins The same applies to politics The candidate who gets the most votes in primary or caucus wins It's that simple.

Iowa should get the equivalent of the NCAA’s “death penalty” for this crap Relegate them to abject irrelevance by giving them the last primary before the Convention.

I SO hate this primary This whole thing needs to be redesigned from the ground up We don't even get halfway through a presidential term before its campaign season again It's way, way too much.
I don’t think there ever was an option   It’s going to be wilder than the Rep primary in 2012, that’s for damn sure   Even if Dems would coast through the primaries, the general election will still be a shitshow  The Internet, the ludicrously high stakes it will be wild.

We are in a primary election that is run according to the rules of the DNC, a private organization - not some ''representative system of the USA'' And well enough, in almost every state the DNC uses proportional representation by vote count.
Also notice the attacks on Sanders from John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and the MSM prior to this primary  It's like they hit panic mode and are starting to play every dirty trick to prevent him from winning.

If Bloomberg wins the D primary those will be your two choices  Welcome to the real world  That said go vote for Jill Stein if you want but don’t complain when Trump savages Obamacare which increased coverage amongst African Americans under 65 by 33%.
Sorry, but I don’t think Bloomberg is a ‘leader’ in the primary He’s just buying his way into the spotlight and his detractors are getting out ahead of it.
Definitely on well into the 70's Started primary school in 70 and remember watching it after school at least P3/P4.
It’s the death primary.
 otherwise we have to admit that our Scriptures are in error Are all the other places God the Father, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the Apostle Paul elevated women in primary leadership roles were wrong? Do a few verses negate the rest of the story of God as seen in Scripture?.

Share your concern  BS has made a couple of statements of avoiding internal fighting but needs to do WAY more How many of the "negative progressives" are bots or genuine??  I like the phrase  You fall in love with your candidate in the primary You fall in line x election.
demanding people talk about voting today on the general for a man who has no delegates and hasn't been on the ballot, is entirely out of order it's one of the weird mind traps used to dodge his limited appeal to primary voters.
I will tell u from my first hand experience that difference Bernies volunteers I worked with in 2016 (supported in primary) to Hillary’s (general) was the overall decorum and respect Bernie became far more negative attack/trump like and it turned me away from support this time.
Where on earth are you getting "because the cases are mild for the first go around" from? You might want to chat with some of the patients in hospitals for weeks on their first "go around" It looks like primary infection causes a cytokine storm, ARDS and multi-organ failure.

He's not the first politician to switch parties  Bernie only registered as a Democrat to run in our primary.
You don’t get! Some people find Bernie intolerable! They are going to support whoever they think can beat him! I’d prefer Just about anyone to Bloomberg, except Bernie! I’ll vote for Warren or Klobachaur in my primary but if it comes to it I’m never Bernie !.

Having read this, it doesn't sound too much like she is directly attacking Bernie Just being her own annoying self Given that she lost the 2008 primary and the 2016 general election, I don't know why she thinks she has any ideas about what it takes to win.
Yeah, imagine candidates getting criticism in a primary election .

Acknowledgement by Mr Trump for complicit acquittal in impeachment trial   The focus on 191 judges confirmed to the bench is a slap to the face of the American people who expect the Senate to take up legislation as their primary duty    #GOPComplicit #ImpeachedNotExonerated.
Their grand scheme started when they shut down the GOP primary because they didn't think Trump would are well against Wash and Weldon  The "meddling" consists of telling Republicans to vote for Sanders in the primary   They were hoping the Dems would go ballistic.
The fact that our choices in 2008 & 2012 were McCain and Romney, convinces me that the Republican primary system is broken Too many open primaries & voter fraud encourage liberals to help select the weakest candidate in the field Reform the primaries for success after Trump.
Once Kamala Harris exited the primary, we stopped having a viable path out of the Trump administration.
We'll be donating to @SenSanders all the way to the last vote count in this primary And do it all over again in the general.
She said it is primary focus in her dept Still, prepare for worst and hope for best I stocked up on hand sanitizer, lysol spray, masks, bleach, laundry soap Now strategizing for items that you'd need if there was a snowstorm for weeks Canned food, bottled water and such .
You could potentially switch parties for the primary and then back to R for the general if you wanted to, and if your state allows it.

I wish it wasn’t, but it’s all about money  The primary reason candidates like Booker dropped out is because of funding  We need to change the rules, but must win first with the rule we have.

Which Democratic party candidate can win the Texas primary and possibly carry the state in the General election #TexasPrimary.
Lisa, I REALLY wish Democrats would SEE this! It's one thing for us Dems to thoughtfully vet pros/cons of OUR primary candidates But Trump's trying to grab OUR primaries by the p & Democrats should NOT enable him by giving his disingenuous "input" ANY amplification!!.
If you think this primary is bad you should take a look at 2000 Rep and 2008 Dem.
My polling place has free cookies They had more than eight packages in the garbage, not bad turnout for Supreme Court primary and mayor's race primary.
That's because winning the GOP primary is now quite the prize  Alabama Senator Doug Jones is TOAST this November TOAST  So whoever wins the GOP primary is going to be Jonesy's de-facto replacement.
I mean me too Blue or bust BUT it can’t be him No way I wish he would have kept doing what he did in 2018 and just invested in getting women and Dems elected without running here’s hoping someone strong surges before our primary.
What conscious choice? I’ve already voted against Bloomberg in the primary I’m just not going to vote for trump in November You’ve turned that into an excuse to berate me for racism several times  And you still sound like you’re trying to convince me to vote trump in November.
Those who miss the early voting window will only be able to participate in the primary on March 3, election day http://bitly/2T8nbdh .
There’s nothing quite like primary season to show how people rely on rumors and memes for their information  The ignorance is staggering It’s like watching Fox.
The Bernie vs Bloomberg campaign speech diss-track soundbites of this US primary cycle Pure .
But the electorate ain’t Paying attention to joe yet Once they see what dem primary voters have seen he would fall like crazy.
You mistakenly believe that Sanders's Twitter peeps care about the general election They just want to "bern it down" in the primary Losing the Electoral College and also dragging moderate Dems like Connor Lamb out of office is actually just part of the purity plan.

I don't know, but lots will happen in the next two weeks for the Democratic field If the delegate count is still fractured 3 or 4-ways after Super Tuesday, it could be a long primary season.
if bernie doesn't win the primary, i swear to GOD.
Yeah Let's review what happens when we "fight smart" We get robbed of a primary victory Get told to shut up about it Side with you anyway, because it's "better than trump" You lose  Then we get the blame anyway No thanks  Not again.
Yes as the green may already know Also of note, that one of the people that would have organised that meeting have organised went onto form the PEOPLE'S CONVENTION, a group that was the primary cork manifestation of the DDI type organisations of a few years ago.

Yes, it's "open" that Undeclareds can vote in either primary I have changed from Undeclared to a party, then back again on the day of election I'm not sure whether you can change from GOP to Democrat on day of the primary.
Jesus can all Dems stop bashing each other and all agree #BlueNoMatterWho? I'm not voting for Bernie in the primary but saying this is just as bad as the Bernie bros We need to all UNITE no matter what, please stop.

Who of these four (middle candidates) do you think will score highest in New Hampshire's First In The Nation primary tonight?.
It makes little sense to leave a party and continue to vote for it even with a better alternative Consider an independent in this primary  If not, the incumbent wins Voting Republican in the primary ensures an incumbent (Democrat) win  https://ballotpediaorg/California%27s_46th_Congressional_District_election,_2020 … helps.

you know I’ve really been thinking hard about who to vote for in the primary do I give my vote to a progressive? or a moderate? a man? or a woman? after many months of deliberation, I have finally decided I will vote for the candidate who gets riff raff to follow me again.
Not true Bernie primary voters had the highest turnout for Hillary of any other dem primary voter in 2016 Voter apathy is how we got Trump There are a lot of Bernie voters who act a whole lot like MAGA voters online, but they are engaged and will show up to the polls.

Her campaign staff deserves to be shot out of a cannon They took a promising progressive campaign and turned it into the sleaziest smear machine in this entire primary.
Between Sanders and Bloomberg only I would honestly vote "No Preference" at this point (an actual option on Montana primary ballots).
I'm in PA too! I plan on registering Independent after our primary I actually recently read an article that there are some Senators trying to pass legislation to allow Independents to participate in elections without being registered to either party.
Unfortunate that this happened on the day of the NH primary That means coverage of the withdrawals, which is huge news, will get buried and probably forgotten within the next few days, like 90% of all Trump outrages.

Well here's where we get into semantics, right? Is calling something "primary," thereby "putting almost all the emphasis" on it? Especially in an election year, in the midst of primaries?   Similarly, does labeling an issue "preeminent" mean no other issues matter?.
Buttigieg was far more likely to be deemed “about right” on the scale of too liberal, about right or not liberal enough in his positions on the issues, according to preliminary exit polls results among Democratic New Hampshire primary voters 1/2 https://twittercom/postpolitics/status/1227380471996264454 ….

The Republican Party is a cult!  This was confirmed for me firsthand in Iowa when I was booed off the stage by primary voters when I said we should expect decency and honesty from our President This is not my party  - Joe Walsh ( Republican)  #GOPCult #MAGAcult #MAGA2020.
Access=influence  Might be necessary to take big donations at special fundraisers when contra Trump in the general election, but we can try to avoid that in the primary, where it gives an advantage to some candidates in exchange for access.

I hope and pray he takes the gloves off  @TheDemocrats @DNC trying to push us toward a socialist nominee by ignoring all black and brown votes just ask your self where would we be today if SC and NV would have been the first primary states? Biden would be already the nominee.
When will @TheDemocrats & fellow candidates demand that the billionaire media magnate running a shadow primary & all about not surrounding self w/"YES!' men unwilling to speak truth to power start paying his own "news" people to speak truth to his campaign power & tell him "NO!"?.
my primary school best friend is still my best friend.
I think so far the only thing they’ve been able to irrupt is their own election process They blame it on anybody but themselves, now I see they’re blaming President Trump for them screwing up their first State primary,can’t wait for the next primary screwup they do MAGA.

Personally, I think the DNC wouldn’t rig the primary for someone who’s biggest qualification is being a mayor, has very low minority support, and polls behind Trump.

That is why I cannot support Bernie in the primary  his supporters are no different than Trumps if we don't stick together we are looking at 4 more years of the orange clown.

All I'm saying is if that's what's happening they might be able to do it  I'm not making any judgement on if that's going on or not or if it's even happening that Republicans are voting in the democratic primary  I'm just pointing out that logistically it's possible.
In this case, journalist’s claims (slanders) were about a book That’s a primary source, anyone can check for themselves, to judge accuracy/fairness of claims  But you’re right, when we have no access to anon ‘sources’ claimed by reporters, there’s no means to hold accountable.
Of course #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 And am voting for @SenWarren in the primary.
