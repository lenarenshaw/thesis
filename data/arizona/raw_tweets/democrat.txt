America's third rail of Medicare, Medicaid and social security are democrat favoured policies Ironically the people that use them the most are poor people from red states If that's socialism, then society needs more of that  /1.

♟A tyranny in a country is a big threat to the whole humanity; a democrat in a country is a great hope to the whole world! Don’t try to look for a character in a person who gave up his freedom, because he does have none! #ChangeTanzania #EqualityForAll #JusticeForAllpictwittercom/cWjLUpkSZV.
