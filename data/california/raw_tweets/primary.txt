Which Democratic party candidate can win the Texas primary and possibly carry the state in the General election #TexasPrimary.
Lisa, I REALLY wish Democrats would SEE this! It's one thing for us Dems to thoughtfully vet pros/cons of OUR primary candidates But Trump's trying to grab OUR primaries by the p & Democrats should NOT enable him by giving his disingenuous "input" ANY amplification!!.
If you think this primary is bad you should take a look at 2000 Rep and 2008 Dem.
My polling place has free cookies They had more than eight packages in the garbage, not bad turnout for Supreme Court primary and mayor's race primary.
That's because winning the GOP primary is now quite the prize  Alabama Senator Doug Jones is TOAST this November TOAST  So whoever wins the GOP primary is going to be Jonesy's de-facto replacement.
I mean me too Blue or bust BUT it can’t be him No way I wish he would have kept doing what he did in 2018 and just invested in getting women and Dems elected without running here’s hoping someone strong surges before our primary.
What conscious choice? I’ve already voted against Bloomberg in the primary I’m just not going to vote for trump in November You’ve turned that into an excuse to berate me for racism several times  And you still sound like you’re trying to convince me to vote trump in November.

But the electorate ain’t Paying attention to joe yet Once they see what dem primary voters have seen he would fall like crazy.
You mistakenly believe that Sanders's Twitter peeps care about the general election They just want to "bern it down" in the primary Losing the Electoral College and also dragging moderate Dems like Connor Lamb out of office is actually just part of the purity plan.

No We win if we have a politician who's more popular then the unpopular cronies that you're promoting McGrath is no better in the primary then the establishment hacks who'd lose to Trump.

demanding people talk about voting today on the general for a man who has no delegates and hasn't been on the ballot, is entirely out of order it's one of the weird mind traps used to dodge his limited appeal to primary voters.
I will tell u from my first hand experience that difference Bernies volunteers I worked with in 2016 (supported in primary) to Hillary’s (general) was the overall decorum and respect Bernie became far more negative attack/trump like and it turned me away from support this time.

omg i thought so but honestly i can’t even tell anymore with this bizarre primary season.
This is so deeply concerning It’s getting almost zero media attention, and the skewed primary results could force a Democratic candidate to withdraw from the race This is straight up *election rigging* Un-American to the core.

All I'm saying is if that's what's happening they might be able to do it  I'm not making any judgement on if that's going on or not or if it's even happening that Republicans are voting in the democratic primary  I'm just pointing out that logistically it's possible.
In this case, journalist’s claims (slanders) were about a book That’s a primary source, anyone can check for themselves, to judge accuracy/fairness of claims  But you’re right, when we have no access to anon ‘sources’ claimed by reporters, there’s no means to hold accountable.
Of course #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 And am voting for @SenWarren in the primary.
 Yeah Sure Whatever you say  I’m not voting for your guy in the primary mostly because his supporters are the most negative arrogant bunch of assholes I’ve seen since Trump supporters 2016 I’ll discourage ppl I know from voting for him as well Have a great day.

I'm sure that you'll then accept that title too if Bernie doesn't win the primary and your choice is Trump or the Democratic nominee I hope is such a case you're ready to cast that vote for the non-Bernie Democrat.

If 2-3 people drop out, he’s done  So, there’s that  He’s only ahead because the others are splitting the votes  Trump did the same thing in 2016  If the Republicans didn’t have 40 people running, Trump wouldn’t have won the primary.
Even if nothing passes The demand will be there The conversation will have begun He was quite effective in making this the main topic of the primary I think it’ll be just fine It’s not like Sanders is going to make any Trumpian moves while in office Or do favors to the rich.

I'm voting for @ewarren in the Ohio primary.
If I remember correctly Clyburn had expressed concerns about Hillary and Bill both and decided not to intervene He had last endorsed Obama This endorsement for Biden is HUGE One of the most significant endorsements in this primary.
I'll vote Elizabeth in the primary - I'd love to have Klobuchar but I think @ewarren really is the best bet going forward from this point(please delete Bernie from everything).
Trump has revealed he is in the plot to rig the democratic primary for Bernie Sanders he's been instructed to take an easy on Sanders for the moment The plan is to install Sanders as nominee then when timing is right use Russia as leverage over Sanders to destroy him.
H is not incorrect The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world The primary impetus was the incredibly horrible "War on Drugs" When Nixon signed that into law we began a nearly exponential growth in incarceration 85% of prisoners are there bcs of some drug offense.

You’re right, I’m not afraid, these children think that if you yell and wag your finger, things will magically happen 50 votes, maybe 60 are required to pass anything in the senate The primary season is almost over, so they’d have to wait until 2022 to unseat any Dems.

Joe Biden hasn't campaigned in any Super Tuesday states in over a month I wonder how that will pan out #SCprimary2020.
democrats literally turned out in the gop primary and voted for trump because they thought he would lose the general to HRC  so, uh, oops.
Does Biden win by a lot? 20% or more? A little? Or does Bernie pull a surprise upset and get close or win? Polls close in 2 minutes #scprimary2020.
Flipping between college basketball and the SC Primary results not a bad Saturday evening! #SCprimary2020 #UGA.
MSM seems preoccupied with race in the South Carolina primary Didn’t hear that much about race before or after the New Hampshire primary Maybe it says something about which candidate they favor.
6+6=12 The percentage of Republicans voting in the open Democratic primary I doubt those numbers are coincidental.
A huge impediment to Sanders’ 2016 campaign was the unanimous narrative that Clinton would win the primary and the general That influenced a lot of votes, and with Sanders now the frontrunner (by a lot!) and best positioned to beat Trump it’s an entirely different situation.
South Carolina primary polls close in 1 minute.

Warren will always take the most convenient road for herself no matter how much it affects others whether it's letting a school claim her as their 1st WOC or saying the DNC rigged a primary against Bernie or flip-flopping on taking PAC money  When people show you who they are.
If EMF is smart they'll make Paxton the primary again, unless that is no longer an option.
I was quite pleased by the debate last night Of course, everyone lost their minds over it Personally, it clarified some things for me before the primary here in April.
@gromerjeffers is on the ground in Nevada ahead of the caucuses and he has this look at @BernieSanders's shifting role in the primary http://bitly/2T1EhsX .
Sorry, Dean, but I can't agree These primary debates help us distinguish between the Democratic candidates I'd rather learn about their differences than listen to them target Trump The general election is the time for them to join together for a full-frontal assault.
I'm for Warren in the primary That's where I can vote my choice, but in November, it's whoever the Democrat nominee is.
Yes Less chance of a brokered rigged convention ending the party permanently Though with for it The last question if Nevada debate transparently set the stage There will be rigging in every primary- just enough  As there was in Iowa and likely NH.
ah yes because republican primary debates have a commanding viewership at 7%.
It's not a change of mind, it's just dishonest She'd already funnelled millions of big donor $ from her senate campaign in to jumpstart her primary run, and took money from several billionaires.

Bernie won the democratic primary in WI in 2016, then Trump only won the general in WI by a thin margin Getting out the young and minority vote will make a difference We just recently a replaced a Republican governor Farmers are going broke, and our metro areas are very blue.

I’m supporting them both publicly and have not yet decided who I’ll vote for in the primary (it depends on what the race looks like at that point and which of the two has the best shot at winning Cali).

I wish that people who constantly say “Vote blue no matter who!!!!” would recognize that they are discouraging people from critically engaging with primary candidates, discouraging political activism, and refusing to allow themselves to think critically or have standards at all.
That's deceivingly low Models dismiss him because he doesn't do well in nat polls, & cuz he missed filing deadlines for early primary states, so he is literally starting behind the others He polls extremely well in Super Tues states (where he's been spending), will get momentum.

hillary actually wanted trump to win the primary too  didn't go too well and he's talking behind the scenes that "socialism" isn't easy to beat  i think bernie might be the only one capable of putting up a fight in the general, the rest of them are bad against him.
Easily the funniest moment of the primary so far has been when Chris Matthews made up the 100% arbitrary “only vote for someone that would save you from a car” standard and then just said Bernie didn’t pass his fictional test  The next day we find out he did save someone.

Correct The primary goal has to be making sure the Dem nominee does not rile up the Trump base and flip Independents to him.
Seems like the inverse of what (at least some of) his supporters said 4 years ago, which was essentially "we're going to do what we can in the primary to make him the nominee, then rally around Clinton in the general if she wins" Now we all need to get behind him immediately?.
Our moral system is a mishmash of primary, secondary and tertiary values and indicators In the confusion this creates, non-primary values can be elevated into primary status This isn't ideal, but it is understandable (Realizing now this is a bit of a tangent wrt your tweet).

Well doesn't need to be DOJ empowering without reforms  Could be both But  I think most Dem primary voters see Harris as a very viable VP or AG, and it'd benefit Warren to just sit and hear her ideas out on this stuff, and be SEEN doing that.

Hello, quick question for my fellow intellectuals: is a collection of broadcasts and or transcripts compiled after they died technically a secondary source? Or is it a primary source because the person in question made those broadcasts that were compiled?.
The primary for state offices is an open primary.
Marco, when he defeated you in the primary race, Trump mocked you and gave you one of his little nicknames and made you a joke Since then, you have made yourself a joke by kissing up to him and ignoring your oath of office, your support and defense of our constitution.

They've done far worse and it didn't spark anything Why should they think this would be any different?  Bottom line is, as much as I hate to admit it, the left is all talk 90% of Bernie's primary voters in 2016 voted for Hillary despite irrefutable proof of rigging.
It's dumb guy politics analysis, but I have a hard time understanding how Joe Biden, who has not yet won or come close to winning a primary, is suddenly expected to win like 6 in four days.
I think you're supposed to point out differences in candidates in a primary How else are you supposed to select a candidate?.

In @ewarren Twitter thread cited, she talks about gen'l elections NOT primary elections, you know PARTY primaries/caucuses where PARTY gets to choose PARTY's candidate for president AND gets to choose PARTY rules for the process She doesn't like SDs but abides by PARTY rules.
I just voted (via absentee ballot) for @ewarren in the CA primary and it felt GREAT  10/10, highly recommended~   #TeamWarren #VoteWarrenpictwittercom/nTUipkyDwd.
You vote because the party decided to have a number of delegates chosen based on the vote of the people, but not all of the delegates are selected this way Again, we don’t have a right to pick a nominee For most of our history neither party used a national primary.
There are many reasons why I will not be voting for Bernie in the primary But scenes like these (and I grew up in VT going to “Bernie Barbecues” with my step-dad and seeing this exact scenario play out probably 100x) is why I’ll be happy voting for him should he get the Dem nod https://twittercom/MikeElk/status/1233529483405205504 ….

@johniadarola is spot on, Democrats suppress the primary and Republicans suppress the general This is how the vulture class maintain a semblance of democracy while controlling the whole mess through a veil of corrupt and deceitful machinations #tytlive.
Y’know, even though I have a memory of voting for Edwards somehow, I’m doing the math and I didn’t turn 18 until 3 months after that primary, so I’m not sure what I’m remembering.
A third of the vote isn’t the will of the people It’s a primary system that isn’t designed for the 21st Century which encourages candidates to stay in come what may and bargain making.
'Privileged' is losing the popular vote in the primary and getting the support of *every superdelegate*, thereby taking the nomination SDs were there to prevent a Trump, not a Sanders  I promise I won't stay home, but I won't vote for the candidate if we have a Hillary 20.

Yes! God yes! I want Trump gone, & I’m terrified of the Reps removing presidential term limits if he gets re-elected He’s thisclose to being a dictator already  I’m not voting for Bernie in the primary though, not now I’m in a Super Tues state so I’ll (1/2).
The one time where he stood up and showed some courage was when he publicly stated he would not allow Trump to illegally divert congressionally authorized money to his stupid border wall He gets threatened with a primary and he caves like a coward on the Senate floor !!!.
No insults from me pal, just lolling at your primary school teaching you your elbows are your shoulders.
To clarify- in normal elections all political buttons/stickers/tshirts must not be visible in the poll  That rule doesn’t apply in Nevada today bc they don’t do typical voting as their primary They do caucuses which are WAY different & actually encourage participants to campaign.
No Joe  It is this caucus fiasco  One person, one vote Can we do a primary like normal people?.
Right, so the Trump/Putin supporters could switch parties and Vote in the DEM primary for Bernie  That is the plan GET BERNIE THE NOMINATION and then beat him in November  Wake Up people You need to vote BIDEN while we still have a Democracy left to fight for.
and none of your "screenshot or clip of Pete claiming he's the legitimate heir candidate because he can't win elections" make it reasonable for the media to ignore the campaign that has won, through single donations against pete's corporate backing, every caucus/ primary so far.

Hell, the sole reason we disagree on some aspects of the Democratic primary is that the Democratic primary exists   Have a single ballot RCV system (ideally STV) that allows people to vote their conscience *and* ensures any elected candidate will have majority support.
Which is exactly why the media would have given Biden 100% of the coverage as he attacked the Trump crime family, especially Jr and Kushner Every time Hunter was mentioned, Jr should have been exposed Trump gave Biden the opportunity to both win the primary and beat him.
Joe Biden has never won a Democratic presidential primary.

Didn't something like 70% of the voters do early voting, which is like a primary? That's pretty all they need to know The voters have spoken Ditch the stupid caucuses.
They only polled Democrats It’s an open-primary state and the republicans have cancelled their primary so that they can vote for Sanders.
That was so absurd Once this primary is decided, I am done with MSNBC.
It’s probably true This is how Russia works; through planting seeds of doubt, encouraging tribalism, splitting the vote We just have to keep this primary from getting too personal so that there are no hard feelings when it comes time to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020.

It’s the primary So, no, they were not supporting him But, if he wins enough votes, he’ll need their support in the general Instead of tearing people down for not voting for him, his supporters need to share why they are voting for him Nothing more or less than that.

Been watching this series  Julie Mugford was doing teacher training at Goldsmiths uni in 1985 & spent some months at my primary school (Ennersdale school in Lewisham, SE London) where she actually taught me  Alexa, you have portrayed her very well indeed  Well done to you!.
This coming out the day of the primary is very fishy, seems like what O'Keefe or Russia would doctor  I'll wait and see if it's real   This will be a dirty campaign year https://twittercom/Jane_WI/status/1227364874558287872 ….

When Bernie comes to NY for our primary he needs to get Cardi B, Romeo Santos, Fat Joe, Remy Ma, and every NYC based artist needs to do a show at United Palace Add some sazón to the melting pot.
I believe they are both awesome athletes My point was based on the number listed for Hill since that was not his primary position on the field.
Is it a @FITN primary without Vermin Supreme? Making an appearance at Tulsi Gabbard's party @WMUR9 #wmur #NHPoliticspictwittercom/HxyhQWOPxC.
If the @TheDemocrats do not immediately disavow Mike Bloomberg, a Republican, and prevent him from primarying as a Democrat, I will not be voting #bluenomatterwho   I won't be voting blue at all   #BoycottBlue.
Yes, it's "open" that Undeclareds can vote in either primary I have changed from Undeclared to a party, then back again on the day of election I'm not sure whether you can change from GOP to Democrat on day of the primary.
Jesus can all Dems stop bashing each other and all agree #BlueNoMatterWho? I'm not voting for Bernie in the primary but saying this is just as bad as the Bernie bros We need to all UNITE no matter what, please stop.
Fun Fact: Bloomberg doesn't even show up on Google's results for the NH primary.
And watching FoxNews covering the democratic primary is #sofun #BernieIsTheFix.
Go try to steal a primary and get caught, grifter.
Who of these four (middle candidates) do you think will score highest in New Hampshire's First In The Nation primary tonight?.
It makes little sense to leave a party and continue to vote for it even with a better alternative Consider an independent in this primary  If not, the incumbent wins Voting Republican in the primary ensures an incumbent (Democrat) win  https://ballotpediaorg/California%27s_46th_Congressional_District_election,_2020 … helps.

#NHprimary #FITN, Amy Klobuchar knows how to effect change throughout the entire political and economic system  It's called systemic change, actually  Only a pragmatic progressive like her, someone not wedded to ideology, could accomplish this    The right experience counts!.
you know I’ve really been thinking hard about who to vote for in the primary do I give my vote to a progressive? or a moderate? a man? or a woman? after many months of deliberation, I have finally decided I will vote for the candidate who gets riff raff to follow me again.
Not true Bernie primary voters had the highest turnout for Hillary of any other dem primary voter in 2016 Voter apathy is how we got Trump There are a lot of Bernie voters who act a whole lot like MAGA voters online, but they are engaged and will show up to the polls.
Delighted to be seated next to a former colleague and one of the best in the business, @margarettalev , on this primary night in New Hampshire We're both hanging with @PeteButtigieg tonight.

Her campaign staff deserves to be shot out of a cannon They took a promising progressive campaign and turned it into the sleaziest smear machine in this entire primary.
Between Sanders and Bloomberg only I would honestly vote "No Preference" at this point (an actual option on Montana primary ballots).
I'm in PA too! I plan on registering Independent after our primary I actually recently read an article that there are some Senators trying to pass legislation to allow Independents to participate in elections without being registered to either party.
Unfortunate that this happened on the day of the NH primary That means coverage of the withdrawals, which is huge news, will get buried and probably forgotten within the next few days, like 90% of all Trump outrages.

The polls hadn’t even closed in New Hampshire, and the presidential primary’s two longtime frontrunners were pulling further apart than ever before https://wwwpoliticocom/news/2020/02/11/new-hampshire-primary-results-2020-114122 ….
Well here's where we get into semantics, right? Is calling something "primary," thereby "putting almost all the emphasis" on it? Especially in an election year, in the midst of primaries?   Similarly, does labeling an issue "preeminent" mean no other issues matter?.
Buttigieg was far more likely to be deemed “about right” on the scale of too liberal, about right or not liberal enough in his positions on the issues, according to preliminary exit polls results among Democratic New Hampshire primary voters 1/2 https://twittercom/postpolitics/status/1227380471996264454 ….
But it isn't an actual primary with delegates They still have to vote absentee Pretty interesting stuff.

For the love of god watching pundits give no pushback against the Bloomberg campaign has already made me slam my desk with my fist twice It is the primaries why aren't we vetting anyone? #NHprimary.
You are such a spiteful woman! What makes you think so little of Americans that you are throwing up the Russia smokescreen AGAIN? You're running a real live COMMUNIST in your presidential primary, who might WIN, and Russia wants TRUMP? Insulting our intelligence STILL!.

I'm going to Milwaukee for sure Already looking for a place to stay It's best we all plan for the trip now We'll have 5 weeks after the last primary before the convention Plenty of time to marshal the troops if we prepare early.
And think about which candidate the Russians what to win the dem primary probably thinking the socialist is easier for 45 to beat Just my 2 cents Even so, #VoteBlueNoMatterWho.
they only want to help bernie win the primary They think he is trump's easiest adversary.

The tree planted by the MSM in 2016 bears fruit If anybody but the preferred candidate wins - in the primary or the general election - the reflexive and hysterical reaction will be the Russians did it, and there will be even less need for actual evidence than before.
The whole Dem primary field is about out of time to use it if they want to stop him from being the nominee If none of them have the goods I'm very skeptical that anyone does.
As an example, during the 1918-19 Spanish Influenza, border closures protected a few farming villages but the primary spreaders of the disease (troops returning from WW1) easily crossed through 100 yrs on with #COVID19, many lessons still haven't been learnt 2/3.
Poll: Klobuchar leads in Minnesota ahead of Super Tuesday primary http://dlvrit/RQWFSw  @AmyKlobuchar.
You have the results of the NV and SC primaries coming in before the NC primary on the 3rd Why wouldn't you wait until those are done in case something dramatically changes; like the candidate you voted for drops out.
I visit my primary provider's website because her up-to-date availability is listed and she uses an online booking app so I can schedule a time/date/duration at my convenience  She also has seasonal "packages" that include a fun activity, and these change from time to time.
So you have zero curiosity as to the timing of the story? If the post also withheld the story until a day before the primary, that’s not interesting to you.
Win the primary and I’ll gladly chip in Although if a tree trunk was running against Gym, I’d send money.
Jesus I would just like to move through my life as a citizen of the richest country the world has ever known without having to worry a misstep might cost me tens of thousands in medical bills  Is it OK if that is my primary concern?.

Many of "us" weren't I was only bullied in primary school and mildly in high school, I dealt out the odd slap to get peace But the WALLS I built in those years took 20 years pull down I pretended for so long that I was thick-skinned I don't want to be that person.
Bernie Sanders is going to win the primary and the White House After that, all you rich, liberal hacks are going to start paying your taxes so all the "proles" can lead the decent lives they always should have Deal with it.

In the primary, sure I’m not voting for Bloomberg then But if he’s the nominee.
Well for one the plan to cut primary care makes no sense to save money Their estimated cost savings is a small 200mil And all of it is short term When you cut primary care you increase the cost to the healthcare system because ER visits and hospital admissions go up.
I learned that it's more about them wanting him to win the primary, bc they think Trump will "easily" win against him in Nov It's disgusting.
Let’s be honest none of work out for health as the primary motivation.
If they wanted to negatively impact Sanders, they would have released the story before the debate so moderators could ask him about it while the largest audience in debate history watched  This is primary season It was bound to drop at an inopportune time regardless of when.
No party preference California sends out voter info to all registered voters so even those who automatically registered as NPP have multiple chances to request a Democratic party ballot if they wish; NPPs cannot vote for the Green Party or Republican party in the primary.
Cenk wont win the primary.
We’re in a primary, why are you looking at the worst choice? Let’s fight for the best choice #BernieBeatsTrump.
I so don’t have a crush on jake at all He’s funny and smart and sarcastic and looked amazing in glasses on NH primary nite but it’s no big deal Honestly, I’m not even looking for a secret relationship.
Oh, I agree, we should be developing everything we've got, and implement those options that are cheapest and most effective, but the primary energy comparison is a flawed one, and it's important not to give it air.
Like it or not, there's going to be skepticism of political reporting from a newspaper owned by one of the world's richest men, particularly given the inequality message dominating the Democratic primary.
