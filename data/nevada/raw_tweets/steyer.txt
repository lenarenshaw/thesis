Those Tom steyer commercials are embarrassing yikes.
I hope POTUS is watching the activities very closely in the derivatives markets, short sales, etc hate for soros,steyer,b'berg et al to do bad things right before the election.
bloomberg is 'worth' $60B  he's now poured $350M into his campaign, far outspending all other candidates COMBINED not counting the other self-funded billionaire (steyer)  $350M/$60B= 0583%  which is equivalent to someone 'worth' $100k spending $583  this is *nothing* to him.
This is a common and misleading trick question; the world has dozens of leaders, no one can be expected to know them all      :</        In interview, #Klobuchar, #Steyer can't name #Mexico presidenthttps://newsyahoocom/interview-klobuchar-steyer-cant-name-213021059html ….
