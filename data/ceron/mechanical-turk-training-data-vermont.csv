Thankfully he move out of Massachusetts. Unfortunately we have the embarassment of Lizzie Warren and Markey. Never mind McGovern. God help us!  How do they get into office?,vermont

Bernie Sanders lost Iowa   #turnmeoninfourwords,vermont
DO NOT NUT ON MY GLASSES I NEED DEM TO SEE,vermont
"It's ok, he is a Dem, no big deal if one of their own does this crap.",vermont
"Methinks you are so ingrained in Bernie that you can't see anything else as possibilities. BTW, amazingly Sanders has gained almost a thousand votes in Black Hawk county with now 95% of the votes. The vote-counting is a clustercluck, but I'm not going down the conspiracy road.",vermont
Damn it I meant to hit corrupt. your poll is flawed now because of my lack or coordination. My apologies.  But yeah this is to be expected. The DNC will burn itself down and help Trump before they allow Sanders to bring a political revolution.,vermont
"Lol, no. Black people know Sanders isn't our guy.",vermont
I hope yang exceeds your expectations but you have been right so far. Love the videos and the negative comments make me laugh ,vermont
PRICELESS! Commie Warren loses again. That woman could never tell the truth and never will.,vermont
"Want to vote in the NY Presidential Primary on April 28th? You need to be registered with a party to do so. Register with a party or change your affiliation by this Friday, February 14th, to VOTE! ",vermont
"Iowa should not be the first, and the caucus model is stupid.",vermont
Anyone: [asks me about my political views] Me: [In Hank Hill voice] do I look like I know what a buttigieg is,vermont
No. In and out baby,vermont
"He is saying stop pandering and getting distracted by stupid stuff that alienates large portions of your voters. He seems to think that Warren has what it takes but is getting bad advice, hopes that she will come to her senses and tack right. Has less faith in others.",vermont
"I live in NJ & work b/w NJ & NY & I have to tell you that most ppl I knew liked Bloomberg as mayor. How the fuck did he get NYers to agree to CHANGE THE LAW so he could be mayor for a 3rd term? You can't get NY'ers to agree on ANYTHING.  I don't WANT to vote for him, but I will.",vermont
