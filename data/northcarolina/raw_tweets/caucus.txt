Well, look at this @GithiomiN @mutethiajeffrey   But I will admit that I got the order of the primary wrong   The Nevada caucus is on the week before the South Carolina primary https://twittercom/KinuthiaMorgan/status/1201564086963716098 ….
The Nevada Caucus is a caucus, and therefore is going to be another sketchy-ass murky shitshow, but the South Carolina Primaries ought to be the first rays of dawn https://twittercom/NateSilver538/status/1229464992052862977 ….
I'd love to but with the primary schedule, we only have 3 days between South Carolina and Super Tuesday so we're head up to Raleigh   Going through Tenn to do some UAW coverage, Republican caucuses in Kentucky then through Ohio to cover the Michigan primary.
Actually South Carolina would be the 2nd primary NEVADA and Iowa were  caucuses.
1) so what, he's a high profile endorsement that made news due to his comments 2) again, so what, these comments were deemed racist by the south carolina black caucus, by joe's own standards he should have disavowed, he refused i know you back biden, man, but just admit it's bs.
oh right it's south carolina caucus (or primary? idk) tomorrow, right? when will we know the upshot of that.
With two days until the Nevada caucuses, nine days until the South Carolina primary, and 12 days until Super Tuesday, we need everyone's help to make sure our movement succeeds  Can you help by making calls to voters? http://berniesanderscom/call .
South Carolina is more populated than the other three states and two of the first three states use a caucus system that limits raw popular vote turnout This isn’t a logical argument you are making https://twittercom/chrisjollyhale/status/1233941839297892352 ….

@Lawrence did you see the tweet where that maga hat trumpist caucused for Bernie Biden was suppose to win NV and suddenly he wins by landslide? How can that be stopped? They are doing same thing in South Carolina who has open primaries That sounds like cheating to me.
Bernie Sanders is reported to be the Democratic frontrunner for the US's 2020 Presidential Election With the Nevada caucus and South Carolina primary still to come, the race is far from over to decide the nominee who will debate Donald Trump later this year  source: NYTimes pictwittercom/4y7Tjj8vvo.
Nevada isn't hosting a Republican caucus and South Carolina Republicans canceled their primary.

Why did @JoeBiden rush off to South Carolina when the next primary caucus is in Nevada?  Is he conceding that one too?.
