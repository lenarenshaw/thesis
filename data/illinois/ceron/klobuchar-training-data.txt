episode 1 of my otherwise film/wine-centric podcast cohosted by one amy klobuchar will simply be 52 minutes of us raucously dunking on mayor peter.
Amy Klobuchar may not be blatantly homophobic, but she definitely feels superior to gays   https://wwwlgbtqnationcom/2020/02/amy-klobuchar-may-not-blatantly-homophobic-definitely-feels-superior-gays/ ….
Are you sure? I could see klobuchar going further w/ the way primaries are set up, depending on who the centrists coalesce around Also: https://twittercom/lyta_gold/status/1229622458598281216?s=21 …https://twittercom/lyta_gold/status/1229622458598281216 ….
Overall support where? She doesn’t have a path to victory & will likely be doing worse in the next 2 states klobuchar is getting undue attention? I thought it was sexism? Maybe it’s that those 2 have somewhat of a base that may coalesce and have big money behind them.

@amyklobuchar so Madam i was thinking I’d support Bloomberg but i just can’t and I’ve been watching you and you’re real and you’re on fire! I am totally down to support you You’re a leader and your a human being unlike we’ve had for 3 years #Genuine #Healing #.
I actually dropped @amyklobuchar from my list of primary possibilities when I saw her demeanor towards @PeteButtigieg during the last debate She couldn’t “presidentially” handle the heat.
I thought klobuchar was terrible She looked insane.
??? I actually did look through the article and only caught a quote by klobuchar, and the reporter specifically included that she did not say they should stop — didn’t see a comparable part for warren, and may have missed the quote, which is why I asked? (And now it’s paywalled).
Y’all why the fuck do we have to waste time on whether klobuchar knows who the president of Mexico is or not.
How has klobuchar made it this far but Kamala has to drop out.
klobuchar notttt stunning tonight #DemDebate.
the way pete listens to men on the stage vs snarling at warren and klobuchar when they speak the misogyny pictwittercom/8gPdQqW5Mu.
did amy klobuchar legit just say that nominating a woman would end sexism on the internet? i’m having a fever dream.
