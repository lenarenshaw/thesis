The questions are rhetorical This is an exercise in partisanship and paranoia All primaries should be open, and all partisans should accept that they can't control the primary process Because controlling the primary process is not democratic.
Most people in your camp use name calling as a primary defense I don’t mind.
Hey dear, Sen Sanders was conspired on by the Democrats during the primary’s last cycle After his supporters gave millions of their hard earned money Bernie folded to the party line and let all his supporters down Bernie is a coward Genuine? Nope! Don’t be fooled again.

@realDonaldTrump @rnc @senatemajldr It seems Nancy Pelosi is making up rules as she goes, thinking the We the People don't look at calendars  She's holding onto the articles of impeachment as long as she can as there are several primary elections in the next 2mths So so wrong.
We'll still not know the outcome of the primary 2020 will be different.

DCCC as it exists today does not fight for progressive primary challengers in any capacity it fights & stymies those challengers in every capacity.

In the 2016 primary election, Bernie pretty consistently *exceeded* expectations of votes compared to polling numbers (One of the reasons for that is a lot of polls are conducted via landlines which young people don't have, so it can warp real overall sentiment) Bernie will.
Dumb question: How do you know an independent is really an independent?  Follow up: If you don't know that, then why are we talking about this? Couldn't Republicans just claim they were Independents and vote in a Democratic primary and ruin everything?.

No one is promoting division We are simply saying wait until our primary (May 19) then throw your support behind the candidate.
This is about defeating Trump I think the dynamics are a bit different this year—and what it will take to defeat him is more than just Dem primary voters.
