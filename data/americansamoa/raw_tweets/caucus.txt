American Samoa caucus bout to pop off.
TIL American Samoa has a caucus.
Do you know anyone who could raise thefunds?  American Samoa caucus is March 3 So not much more time.
Too many choices in today's world, but we need someone who has the experience to make all the tough decisions, even between tagalongs, samoas, and thin-mints  = = = #joebiden joebiden #nevada #vegas #caucus… https://wwwinstagramcom/p/B8nHShjnx0r/?igshid=ni7f11vw12mf ….
Who do we think will win the American Samoa Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday?.
#EngagedNation  Are you ready for #SuperTuesday ?   14 states will hold primaries and American Samoa its caucus to determine their candidate for president  #CAPrimary #Election2020 #CivicEducation #StatePrimaries… https://wwwinstagramcom/p/B9CVFTjq927/?igshid=1x1qhifcldink ….
I did not know that they caucus in American Samoa for the primaries.
I certainly hope she has a team in American Samoa  If she can’t clinch that caucus, she may be in serious trouble!.
 Exactly my thoughts  American Samoa is having a caucus on Super Tuesday  6 delegates are up for grabs https://twittercom/DennisPotvinDem/status/1231727634490560512 ….
Not quite  Wyoming and North Dakota also still caucus, as well as American Samoa, Guam, and USVI  https://wwwnytimescom/2020/02/04/us/politics/what-states-caucushtml ….
@GingerGibson your piece about Super Tuesday has errors!  American Samoa is NOT the only place with caucus!.
American Samoa has announced their caucus plan Caucus will start at 9 am local, 12 pm Pacific, 3 pm Eastern on Super Tuesday Presumably these will be the first results we get on that day! 6 delegates at stake http://asdemscom/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AS_DSP_2020-FINALpdf …pictwittercom/5uCJ1lfQqG.
Back in 1988 the Democratic Primary held 13 caucuses Kansas, Maine and Hawaii used to have them Now it’s just Iowa, Nevada, Wyoming, American Samoa, North Dakota, Guam, and the Virgin Islands   That’s six too many.
I vote March 3rd Has to be Super Tuesday, because there’s 15 Primaries, plus the caucus in American Samoa   Hoping this DSA nonsense gets a serious hit before that, but definitely willing to give them a slapdown if not.
Avrà la sua occasione nei mitici caucus di Samoa al Super Tuesday.
Even though I despise Warren, she is right on this She said "55 states and territories to go"  American Samoa caucuses Northern Mariana Islands caucuses Guam caucuses District of Columbia primary United States Virgin Islands caucuses.
In case anyone's wondering, American Samoa has 6 pledged delegates, proportionately allocated with a 15% threshold What are the odds >15% of AS caucus goers will caucus for someone who was born there?  http://wwwthegreenpaperscom/P20/AS-D#0303 .
Residents of DC only vote in Nov (23rd Amendment) while those in US territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, etc) only vote in earlier primaries/caucuses #SuperTuesday's got 15 Dem Primaries (including @DemsAbroad), 13 Rep Primaries, & American Samoa's caucus (March 8) #Election2020https://twittercom/TheJournal_MVSA/status/1227454385300611084 ….
Thank god once Nevada is over we just have the American Samoa caucus and then we can say bye bye to all these ridiculous numerology tests.
A 2 días de #SuperTuesday cuenta de delegados se apretó: @BernieSanders 56 @JoeBiden 48 (33 solo en #SouthCarolinaPrimary) @PeteButtigieg 26 @ewarren 8 @amyklobuchar 7 Martes primarias en 14 estados y demócratas en extranjero y caucus en territorio American Samoa #Election2020.
The US billionaire and Democratic Party presidential hopeful, Michael Bloomberg, has sent representatives to American Samoa to drum-up support in the party's territorial caucus https://wwwrnzconz/international/pacific-news/410731/bloomberg-campaign-rolled-out-in-american-samoa ….
1of 2 Super Tuesday is the closest thing we have to a national primary On March 3, more than a dozen states will hold primaries, as will Democrats abroad The American Samoa Democratic caucuses are also set to take place.
He’s projected to win 6, Biden 5, Klobuchar 1 Virginia is leaning Biden and Texas is a total toss-up Nobody really knows what will happen in the American Samoa caucuses.
The polls are about to close in South Carolina, where voters will decide the fourth contest in the 2020 race Former Vice President Joe Biden is hoping to get a much-needed boost heading into Super Tuesday, when 14 states and American Samoa will hold their primaries and caucuses pictwittercom/nv547Byk5v.
They also aren't small states They are the 5th and 6th largest Super Tuesday states (out of 14 primaries + American Samoa caucus), both with far more delegates than South Carolina!.

This theory's gonna fall apart when Pete sends his eighth request for a recount in the American Samoa caucus in March 2021, still contesting his fourth place finish.

Iowa, Nevada, Wyoming and North Dakota are the only Caucus states left That’s down from 13 in 2016 Guam, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands also hold caucuses They should have all been converted to primaries by now #votersuppression #nevadacaucuses.
Bought a box of Samoas from some enterprising Girl Scouts at the caucus site I visited   A half hour into our live coverage, @cgrisales @MilesParks @barbarasprunt and I have eaten them all.
Do you currently live in American Samoa? If so, remember to caucus on Super Tuesday!.
Just FYI: The next caucus will be held on Super Tuesday in American Samoa #NVCaucus.
Nevada caucus not only made up of Latino Electric! there are black asians Samoa Islanders of great importance as well is a news consumer I ask that you report the news and let me decide what's important.

So this further amplified rural representation for the national delegates awarded I believe that second level of delegates are only in caucus states of which I think only Nevada and American Samoa are left 2/2.

Tomorrow At the Nevada Caucus  Needs a hashtag Apart from getting 40 votes in American Samoa, caucuses are the best bet for picking up a national delegate  There's probably going to be a brokered convention, so he only needs one I doubt the DNC will let him speak without it.
