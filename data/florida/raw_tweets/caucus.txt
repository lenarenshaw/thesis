BUTTIGIEG IS OUT??? thought he "won" the Iowa caucus tho????.
If I had to leave my wife and kids and job behind to spend all that time at a caucus I just wouldn’t be able to vote.
Pete Buttigieg ended his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday, failing to keep momentum after narrowly leading the Iowa caucuses early last month  https://dailyiowancom/2020/03/01/iowa-caucus-winner-pete-buttigieg-end-presidential-bid/ ….
So, are we going to be doing an Iowa caucus first in 4 years or nah?.
Very broadly - KDP doesn't have any faith-based caucus, and the discussion is whether to attempt to form one, and what it should look like.
Friendly reminder: Biden has NEVER won a state in a primary or caucus in the 30+ years he’s been running for President (1988, 2008, 2020)  But he’s the electable candidate?.
Minnesota changed to a primary on Super Tuesday this year but we still have a caucus- which is TONIGHT- for State election business Pete people are showing up w/Pete gear & swag but Presidential candidates can't be discussed in the caucus Hubby's going Me: Debate watch party!.
Never heard of you, but I’ve have heard of AIPAC Did you know they took out antiBernie ads prior to NV caucus, interfering in our elections? For far too long the Palestinian ppl have had no voice against the violence It’s possible to support both I condemn your tweet #Wrong.

I would believe that Sanders can win if he could get him voters to actually run out to vote for him at this point increased turnout has benefitted Biden and Sanders has failed best in low turnout caucuses.
Why aren't the 3 mill uncounted CA votes a bigger story? NYT only has 61 unaccounted for delegates in CA: How is that with so many outstanding ballots? Seems like a way bigger problem than the Iowa caucus results being botched but little noise on it   https://electionscdnsoscagov/statewide-elections/2020-primary/unprocessed-ballots-reportpdf ….
Sanders only lasted as long as he did in 2016 because of caucuses.
for everyone who keeps shouting Sanders can't with the south - this mayor held a town caucus and endorsed based on the will of the citizens  He endorsed @SenSanders Beautiful  https://wwwbuzzfeednewscom/amphtml/ryancbrooks/bernie-sanders-2020-mississippi-endorse-lumumba?__twitter_impression=true ….

In 2020 Sanders has tried to tried contest Iowa caucus result 5 times to take away the First LGBT Presidential Candidate to win the majority of the state’s delegates So Sanders supporters really shouldn’t be talking about how Sanders is the unity candidate.

I know NY is smarter I'm in Virginia and people can cross over (like in SC) It just needs to stop And the whole caucus thing needs to end too.
#Bernie supporters only ones organized to actually canvass here in CO Today, we turned out to caucus for US senate & downballot races in numbers to deny Frackenlooper getting statewide 10% threshold to elect @sunrisemvmt backed @Romanoff2020  step outside your bubble #NotMeUs.
Is this a primary or caucus.
Does Bridges pick his caucus bench on the basis of who lies the most because he's an exemplar and learnt from the best Shonkey.

He lost iowa caucus too Just sayin.
Abby and Robbie break down the ongoing catastrophe of the Iowa caucus, the media coordination to undermine Bernie Sanders and boost Pete Buttigieg, Trump's surreal State of the Union and how Rush Limbaugh is a neocon monster who has done grave damage  https://podcastsapplecom/fr/podcast/media-roots-radio/id718967852?i=1000464905234 ….
The republican liberty caucus would be better on the higher levels.
When Seattle was passing its sick leave law back in '12, there was a group of restaurant owners that wanted to incentivise food workers with dripping mucus coming into work  The snot caucus.
Many people of the caucus don’t claim to be middle eastern they claim to be euros, and Cyprus is part of the EU And there’s no fetish to being european It’s just funny how Turkey used to be considered european and now it’s not  I’m just saying it’s social construct lol.
it’s racist cuz when i had locs n nails this caucus man said i was tryna look like medusa so they know what they doin.
And I will haunt him as well From beyond the caucus! Bahahaha! I bought so much air time, I’ll burn him beyond the primaries! Muahahaha!!.

What was conflicting there? The app only reported the totals It's near impossible to rig a caucus What exactly do you think the IDP did to the caucus?.
I wasn't aware that not only had they finished counting Sanders' states, but they had done every other caucus in America too Huh.
  Those same Democrat voters in Democrat primaries & caucuses who didn't vote for @SenBooker, @JulianCastro, @AndrewYang, & @DevalPatrick are #racist !! #MAGA2020https://twittercom/KellyannePolls/status/1235618175976214529 ….
Pete Buttigieg sending a paid staffer to spread the rumor at Iowa State that Warren supports conversion therapy before the caucus (allegedly).
@maddow Bernie will lose in WA tonight  in 2016, he invaded the caucus and won the delegates  In the Primary that year Hillary skunked him but it didn't count  In 2020 with a primary, he will get skunked again.
885,000 voted in the 2020 primary 318,000 voted in the 2016 caucuses So @Ilhan wants to keep the vote away from over half a million Minnesotans in order to protect Bernie.
mom caucused for Bernie in ‘16 & dad voted in the primary  They are poor working class, parents of 4 with two incomes & never connected w/or trusted a politician til they heard Bernie speak Also they never felt their vote would matter  They are far from alone.
If GOP controls your state, they control the locals & time of ALL voting The exception are the caucus states GOP pullEd this same crap here in NC to make it more difficult for voters who Democratic to vote.
Don't be too sure in re: Warren I had the same suspicions, and was really ambivalent about voting for her, even though she's my first choice (Biden is my second, and that's the end of the list) During NV caucuses, I was an observer, and saw 4 of the 5 Warren ppl go to Amy.
What saved the Biden campaign was an actual primary with high turnout and not caucuses https://twittercom/AsteadWesley/status/1234921042444980224 ….

The Democrats’ first four contests include two caucuses, an open primary, and a semi-open primary (And the first two contests are in nearly all-white states) Hard to imagine a worse way to start the nominating process.
Sorry it’s Mex-American caucus “State Rep Rafael Anchía, a Dallas Democrat who leads the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said Sanders does not have a winning message for November when Democrats are trying to win the Texas House for the first time in two decades“ source pictwittercom/B3DV5ddX4g.
In @ewarren Twitter thread cited, she talks about gen'l elections NOT primary elections, you know PARTY primaries/caucuses where PARTY gets to choose PARTY's candidate for president AND gets to choose PARTY rules for the process She doesn't like SDs but abides by PARTY rules.
65% of caucus goers where white?.

oh right it's south carolina caucus (or primary? idk) tomorrow, right? when will we know the upshot of that.
Somehow both of you got my pronouns wrong lol, but superdelegates were coming out in favour of specific candidates after each state’s individual primary/caucus Things like this influence election outcomes pictwittercom/4iQzz9vDrr.
The thing is it’s not really a true democratic vote when there are caucuses and open primaries where Republicans are voting for Sanders in order to sabotage the Democratic Party.
Sure he is he votes with the Democrats, he caucuses withe the democrats he goes along with the democrats coups  He's a dem.
Clinton won Iowa by the closest margin in the history of the state's Democratic caucus O'Malley suspended[b] his campaign after a distant third-place finish, leaving Clinton and Sanders as the only two candidates.
He caucus with dems and uses our party name to run for president   Get your own story straight.
They were told to restrict travel, they didn't listen, they were told to restrict border traffic, they didn't listen Democrats can't even run a caucus and they want us to feel sorry for them?.
