The Democrats’ first four contests include two caucuses, an open primary, and a semi-open primary (And the first two contests are in nearly all-white states) Hard to imagine a worse way to start the nominating process.
Somehow both of you got my pronouns wrong lol, but superdelegates were coming out in favour of specific candidates after each state’s individual primary/caucus Things like this influence election outcomes pictwittercom/4iQzz9vDrr.
The thing is it’s not really a true democratic vote when there are caucuses and open primaries where Republicans are voting for Sanders in order to sabotage the Democratic Party.
Net favorables among Hispanic Democratic caucus goers in Nevada  Sanders 83/16 (+67%) Warren 69/23 (+46%) Steyer 45/43 (+2%) Biden 48/50 (-2%) Klobuchar 30/37 (-7%) Buttigieg 32/48 (-16%)  Gabbard 24/42 (-18%) Bloomberg 22/53 (-31%)  http://filesforprogressorg/datasets/2020/ .
Friendly reminder: Biden has NEVER won a state in a primary or caucus in the 30+ years he’s been running for President (1988, 2008, 2020)  But he’s the electable candidate?.
Minnesota changed to a primary on Super Tuesday this year but we still have a caucus- which is TONIGHT- for State election business Pete people are showing up w/Pete gear & swag but Presidential candidates can't be discussed in the caucus Hubby's going Me: Debate watch party!.
Never heard of you, but I’ve have heard of AIPAC Did you know they took out antiBernie ads prior to NV caucus, interfering in our elections? For far too long the Palestinian ppl have had no voice against the violence It’s possible to support both I condemn your tweet #Wrong.
@gromerjeffers is on the ground in Nevada ahead of the caucuses and he has this look at @BernieSanders's shifting role in the primary http://bitly/2T1EhsX .
Well 90% or better of the progressive caucus is all in on one candidatethey work w/ both, so you'd think they'd have a good idea who's progressive and who isn't #OnlyBernie.
Is Nevada going to mess with the caucus like they did last election?.
And he’ll do it again if we nominate him for president  PS That’s why he caucuses with the Dems It’s in exchange for them not backing a Dem challenger for his seat Quid pro quo.
Or caucus.
Didn't something like 70% of the voters do early voting, which is like a primary? That's pretty all they need to know The voters have spoken Ditch the stupid caucuses.

I’d like to know how Chris Matthews doesn’t get fired or at LEAST suspended for comparing a Jewish man’s win in a caucus to the Nazis invading France.
To clarify- in normal elections all political buttons/stickers/tshirts must not be visible in the poll  That rule doesn’t apply in Nevada today bc they don’t do typical voting as their primary They do caucuses which are WAY different & actually encourage participants to campaign.

One three-time precinct chair, who led a caucus in Henderson this year, just wrapped up their caucus and told me it "went much better than expected," before adding, "yay, we're not Iowa".
All of the Sanders volunteers diligently did the caucus math on their own worksheets and submitted final pictures of the official math We literally have the receipts #NVCaucus.

I don’t trust caucuses  I’ll wait to completely give up hope of someone defeating Sanders, until he wins some more primaries.
maybe reflect on your own gullibility for believing a claim that is suddenly leaked a day before the Nevada caucus when Bernie is leading the polls, a claim for which the intel agencies ofer absolutely NO details or evidence whatsoever.
I would pause maybe on the “culinary” talk They might support Bernie but also Just because you caucus on the strip doesn’t mean you’re culinary at all.

Do you think perhaps *some* of Bernie’s primary support is coming from Republicans who will end up voting for Trump in the general? It’s not like they make you show a Dem membership card when you go to caucus .
Jonathan, that’s willfully misleading Primary/caucus voters on the activist left of the party don’t speak for the electoral prospects of the candidate in the general election.

The only thing that makes less sense to me than a caucus is why primaries aren't done 5-10 states at a time   I know people are dumb, but it is BAFFLING to me that after two years of campaigns and debates, you'd be undecided until a candidate visits a local restaurant.

one good thing about caucuses (that would be better shown in ranked choice) is that you get a much better feeling for how the electorate understands the 'sameness' of different candidates, especially with so many running  going to see a huge flow of warren to sanders support.

I watch CNN on election days and Sundays I watched CNN all morning, they hyped the Sanders Russia story to a vomit worthy level, doing exactly what they claim Russia's interference is designed to do divide Dems Their caucus coverage has been ok.
Hilarious because there was no caucus for republicans here.
During that whole sit down curious which lady was it that said "Money" when you were listing things to throw on the floor that might get in the way of Sanders, and wonder what exactly she meant by that https://wwwcnncom/videos/politics/2020/02/22/van-jones-react-bernie-sanders-nevada-caucus-initial-results-vpxcnn/video/playlists/2020-nevada-caucuses/ ….

Yes Now is 27 delegates for Bernie and 9 for Biden But we have to see the final results When I speak about American politics I love to watch and know statistics, County, all I need to know about a primary or a caucus This is my point of view.
Add getting the primary/caucus rules changed to favor him and the answer is yes.
Is Nevada an open caucus? I see rethugs voting for BS to mess with the primary nominee Everyone knows Trump wants BS Are rethugs voting for BS to inflate his totals??? Just asking.
My bet on the Iowa caucus is still open, paddypower not having any of Pete's shit.
This is the dumbest shit I’ve seen though The candidate who is polling the highest at every single caucus is the one who has a chance at beating trump MATH JUST MATH.
BERNIE IN THE LEAD: Bernie Sanders led Nevada’s presidential caucuses based on early returns Saturday as the fiery progressive pushed for a second straight victory in the Democrats’ 2020 nomination fight  https://wwwkron4com/news/national/sanders-takes-early-lead-in-nevada-democratic-caucuses/ ….
If the Democrat leadership had any sense they would eliminate caucuses in 2024 You know, if America still has elections then.
I like how Chris Matthews keeps saying that Bernie Sanders is a totalitarian while Trump utterly undermines the Federal government and the GOP literally cancels primaries and caucuses to support him.
Tells you a lot, right there (NYT) -  "43% of Democratic Nevada caucus-goers say healthcare is the issue that mattered most to them when deciding which candidate to support Another 25% said it was climate change, 18% said it was income inequality and 9% said foreign policy".
I'm sure having campaign representatives run a caucus won't invite any bias or error into the results This is fine https://twittercom/lbarronlopez/status/1231296473318313984 ….
Dems love to use the word "chaos" when describing the @realDonaldTrump administration   Well after the Nevada caucus   It’s safe to say that the Democrat party is in a deep state of CHAOS.

EvidentlyThey don't mind being bashedI don't trust caucusesWe have a closed primary and that's the way it should beThis way only Democrats vote.
The MSNBC liberals can either claim Sanders is paranoid and no different than Trump since he complains about the media's treatment of him OR they can have on-air breakdowns after each primary or caucus, but they dont get to do both.
They cancelled the republican caucus Disenfranchising republican voters Of course they endorsed - sycophants just like the rest of @GOP.
I am not surprised that @BernieSanders is winning caucuses It’s like pundits haven’t listened to anyone for years Jesus Get it together, people @ewarren has been saying the same things That’s why Biden isn’t in the count All Putin needs to win is chaos - not a candidate.
Bless these ladies A lot of the casinos made people use the caucus as their lunch break if they were going to vote- they’re real patriots and it warms my heart like I can’t explain.
And Iowa wonders why we are ready to revoke their caucus clout!!!.

It should be noted that in many NV caucuses, the Biden campaign had no campaign workers show up.

You obvsly want to mold this story rather than report it!  Sandernistas protested Iowa caucus results - where was this snide attitude from you then?? You are promulgating a false narrative, colluding in a harmful anti-democratic charade to smear a good man Shame on you.
But not until it dropped right before the NV caucus.
Nevada has closed caucuses You must be registered as a Democrat to participate.
Like rigging the caucus and nomination process against the winning candidate? That’s only a Democrat thing.
More than 24 hours later Nevada has reported 60% of their caucus results, less than Iowa in the same timeframe  Why no outcry? Cause their contest was NO contest, and early numbers came as expected   Just an Iowan defending his state over here.

It's quite the opposite Everyone else keeps saying that he isn't a Democrat even though he caucuses with them and is on the board for outreach and was the first to sign the agreement when he ran for president to support the nominee regardless of if he wins.

Good meeting on Akl issues with our @nzlabour AKL MP caucus @michaelwoodnz @BeeFaerie @priyancanzlp with @phil_goffpictwittercom/FLvsIrviZk.
2016 numbers: 30% (IL) 28% (MI/OH) 26% (IN) 31% (WI) So he didn't keep it particularly close Though he got like 43% in 2020 MN, which was a caucus in 2016, so we can't do an apples-to-apples comparison.
Don't be too sure in re: Warren I had the same suspicions, and was really ambivalent about voting for her, even though she's my first choice (Biden is my second, and that's the end of the list) During NV caucuses, I was an observer, and saw 4 of the 5 Warren ppl go to Amy.

I'll give it a try this weekend! Might be doable in some states, but there are so many variables this time that it'll be hard to do at the county level Right off the bat, we went from like 14 caucus states to just 3 That makes 2016 comparisons almost impossible there.
I find it hella sus that everyone dropped out and decided to endorse Biden, especially after his poor performances in the caucuses and debates I’m nervous about a repeat of 2016, whether it’s with Biden or Sanders Either way, Bloomberg can go pound sand.
Both caucus states are high.

I was concerned, and that why I caucused for @ewarren She's "only" 70 I have a feeling that if Biden wins, he'll decline a second term in favor of his VP.
@trish_zornio There were three people at my precinct caucus, so I somehow got two delegates for you all by my lonesome? I don’t understand how this math works, but okay I’m probably going to need a proxy.
Just came back from democratic caucus in CO -- really stoked that our precinct will send 5 delegates for @Romanoff2020, 1 for @StephanyForCO  -- and none for Hickenlooper A strong turnout for progressive voices in Colorado today!.
Oh, the head troll became the head of the local progressive caucus They took the step of endorsing Bernie (which I'm told they're not supposed to do) and probably upset anyone who was a Warren backer in the process Won't matter here in Miami He praised Castro .

As someone who actually lives here? It's a lot more accurate than you might think If Bernie does take it, it'll be a squeaker No way in hell is he getting the 70%+ he got from the caucus.
