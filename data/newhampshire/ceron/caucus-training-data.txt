In 2016, @BernieSanders over-performed on caucus day with respect to Iowa primary polling He's gonna win Iowa, then New Hampshire & California, and then the nomination @TheYoungTurks @TYTLive.
Iowa doesn’t count because it’s a caucus he was supposed to win New Hampshire book it.
20 days until the #IowaCaucus  28 days until the New Hampshire primary  39 days until the Nevada caucuses  47 days until the South Carolina primary  50 days until #SuperTuesday.
