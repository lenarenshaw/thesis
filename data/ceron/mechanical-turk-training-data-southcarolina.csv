"The hope is Buttigieg is an Iowa and New Hampshire candidate and crashes, Biden wins South Carolina and people don't buy what Bloomberg is selling.   Does that happen? Maybe, but there is a risk for a Santorum and Gingrich situation.",southcarolina

Biden dropping daily and Steyer barely pegs polls. Biden also lost support of some Black leaders in South Carolina last week.,southcarolina
I think the argument is that Iowa(and NH) is a state where Bernie/Buttigieg/Warren/Klobuchar type can over perform and Biden has states like South Carolina to lean on (although I question this assumption).,southcarolina
Awesome! #CaucusForYang,southcarolina
"Biden's reliance on South Carolina reminds me of Jeb! If he hasn't won any state before South Carolina, he probably won't win there either.",southcarolina
"I read magats were calling & bogging up the lines, saying they wanted to vote for Trump. I'm sure that didn't help. Republicans are being instructed to vote for Bernie in South Carolina's democratic primary, so Joe doesn't get the votes...  They can't win unless they cheat.",southcarolina
I just realized what it is about Buttigieg that peeves me so much (that's unrelated to politics). He's such a fucking Karen. Also I'm still not over the fact that his campaign didn't get publicly executed for straight up faking 400 black South Carolina supporters.,southcarolina
I think I saw Sanders #1 with Latinos but a clear #2 with Black's. South Carolina being in play is pretty big news for Sanders and crushing for Biden,southcarolina
"South Carolina TV airways are beginning to be invaded by Democrats colluding with the Russians. These Communists (Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Bloomberg) are telling South Carolina Folks that they will provide them ""FREE"" when they make them their leader. Help beat them back.",southcarolina
He's now behind Sanders. Plus Iowa is like a pinprick. If Biden wins South Carolina he will probably be the nominated one.,southcarolina
I'm honestly wondering what happens if it comes down to Sanders and Buttigieg in South Carolina. Will Bloomberg still be around then? Or Warren?,southcarolina
"They have moved everyone up, Nevada has their stupid caucus before South Carolina primary this year.   They also moved Super Tuesday up two weeks, making it even more important New Hampshire realize that hope and change of a Woman president needs their help. ASAP.  pic.twitter.com/4dOqstNEh8",southcarolina
Bill Clinton lost the Iowa caucus too. Big test is going to be the South Carolina black vote.,southcarolina
"The two are employing different strats. People say Pete just isn't doing well with poc voters. The first two states are extremely white (no offense just the numbers). Places like California, South Carolina, the south. And for the south Buttigieg is a gay man. A lot to be decided",southcarolina
"Why are we talking about Bloomberg, Carolina?   It's this lack of focus that causes people to complain about you at work.",southcarolina
