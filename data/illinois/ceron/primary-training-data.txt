Yes, she's willing to compromise to get things done That is one of the primary positives I see of her over Sanders.
Why vote in the democratic primary if you are not a democrat?.
I know it’s not the primary modality of every or even most therapists, but I guess I did assume some awareness.
The cult accusations are all projection The primary and polls are revealing that the true cult is the NeverBernie bubble that is blind to his broad popularity and the fact he would clearly be the strongest nominee.
He should grow his beard out He should also drop out of the primary.
Trump is a criminal, engaged in a criminal coverup Despite all the froth in the primary  We have to remember and continue to hammer this fact every day in every network we have access to https://twittercom/SallyQYates/status/1230842748233711616 ….
I am sick and tired of Democrats and Republicans  I am an American not a puppet that votes for #Trump because I am a Republican but doesn’t vote In the Democrat primary because it’s not my party  One of those people are going to make it to the election which will ultimately.

As in she did what she had to do to ward off an administration-backed primary challenge by Colins?.
I’ve often said that Trump exhibits the primary characteristics of every single villain in Heller’s novel.

NeverTrump & mods are delusional if they think Democratic primary voters are going to take the side of the billionaire in a super billionaire vs Bernie 1-on-1 media war Defying the ability to buy the nomination is the best Sanders GOTV operation possible.

The clearest lesson of this primary, is the people making the broadest declarations about cultural/racial voter preference continuously being the most wrong take.

She hasn't won a single primary state.
I went from supporting Warren to Sanders in the primary, regardless I will support whomever wins the candidacy I really like Klobacher on the centrist side of the primary I prefer someone on left-left Vote blue no matter what, we need to get Trump out of office.

Illinois peeps PLEASE check to make sure you’re registered to vote in primary on March 17th!! Today is the deadline to register https://votesaveamericacom/verify/ .
I think its the truth though They're not going to do him any favors (intentionally, thru incompetence certainly) 1 of the 10 richest ppl in the world has come on the scene to stop him Idk what shooting in the back refers to, but winning the primary was always going to be ugly.
Yes but that’s not my concern at this time I’m focused on the primary elections’ outcome.
No it’s not, in a state such as the one where I live, when one can request a ballot of either party when voting in the primary election We don’t swear an oath to a particular party!.
In Illinois when voters come to the polling place (or request a ballot to vote by mail) in the primary election, we are able to request a Republican, Democratic, or Independent ballot, so of course Republicans could vote for Bernie if they get a Dem ballot.
She finished 10pts behind them in the most recent primary held in a neighboring state People are insane to think there wouldn't be consequences for that type of showing You have to produce.

The tax cut is about all he got You're not being objective & honest w/ yourself if you think they can win a primary running against the president from their own party The act of his winning would put to bed the perceived lack of popularity People like a winner, esp vs Trump.
Why will a Sanders takeover play out differently in the minds of the party's voters, than it did with Trump? If he wins, how does a Dem member of Congress go against him, and expect to survive a primary?.

It's President's Day, so I'll make it official: my vote in the IL primary goes, enthusiastically, to @ewarren   I want a president who listens and learns and cares and plans, and that's Elizabeth Warren  (I represent just me, not my organizations) pictwittercom/OISb2dxbmY.
Exactly, I HATE it That's why I'm just telling everyone that I could care less if she's "viable" by the time of the Illinois primary, my vote is going to Warren https://twittercom/OG_KG1/status/1229565572549091328 ….
Maybe not Don't vote for him in the primary but if you take that attitude to November, you might as well just vote for #45.
Caucuses seem designed primarily for the benefit of party leaders who want a process other than a strictly democratic one Like ranked choice? Do a primary with ranked choice.

It matters not whether English is your primary or second  language the fact of the matter is that English is nuanced and layered just like everything else Thus, it is not as clear cut as you try to  make it.
Bernie wanted to Obama what Kennedy did to Carter He wanted to primary America’s first African American President #Bernieisasnake.
Don’t run in the democratic primary then.
He has 1/3 of delegates now That means 2/3 of primary voters don't stand behind him And the D primary voters are a minority of all voters Maybe 1/3 So 1/9 is behind him?.
Illinois primary is March 17, so move fast!.
This is still primary time That slogan is useless.
As alienating as welcoming the 10th richest person in the world into the primary to spend an unlimited sum of money to force a brokered convention? Get a grip.
You understand that even more people aren't voting for EVERY SINGLE OTHER CANDIDATE when they turn out to vote in the primary?.
It is an early payment that I can cut off at any time and use in a place where I need some cash money now Some people are ok with heavy leverage I like a mix of owning my primary residence and mortgaging all of my rentals It depends on your personal financial risk tolerance.
Ok I'll explain it this way As we have known since 2016, the primary goal has been for Russia to divide the Democrat electorate, and it's working The result is the problem to me, not what is being taken at face value.
If @ewarren really thought she stood a chance of winning, why isn’t she going after “front runner” Bernie? I mean, at all? Why continue to focus on Bloomberg who dropped off massively after the debate? I’m so over this primary.

My last day at @NBA was Jan 15, 2003 One of the reasons I left to start #GameplanChicago was Adam Silver moving primary brand responsibility to Global Merchandising Group (you know the names) who did NOT have design chops to solve brand challenges witness past 17 years.
I agree with you about voting Dem no matter who, but I don’t find that to be helpful in deciding which candidate to vote for in the presidential primary.

you probably hate to hear it, but im #StillVotingForYang in the IL primary Ive gone over the alternatives in my mind and heart and nothing else makes sense.
Face it Even with 27% of support right now That is 27% of Democratic primary voters  He has several things against him that GOP will push on (health, socialism,) And the economy is good, and Trump cheats Sanders is a weak card.
Going out on a limb here, but I really don't care who famous people are backing in the primary Twitter is full of endorsements like everyone's the goddamn New York Times.
“He, she, or it”?  Fuck this Republican and get out of my primary  #BloombergDropOut https://twittercom/airwolfparade/status/1229897657658703872/video/1 ….
At the end of this primary cycle, their streams will likely converge We should welcome our progressive friends They will only compete for so long before they become allies again.
Technically, he doesn’t have to win any primary elections and try to win over delegates at the convention as a “dark horse” nominee.
if you insist on voting for a centrist this primary season, just remember: biden has beliefs, buttigieg has none.
Speculation about what's going to happen in 9 mo's is far less predictive of how this primary will play out than current numbers Voters see Sanders winning & with the most support in polls, and for better or worse see him as the strongest chance vs Trump b/c of that.

Poll after poll show voters #1 issue is the first 3 primary states is HEALTHCARE! @Marie4Congress is the only candidate in #IL03 that will fight to make health care a right! #MedicareForAll #NewDayinIL03.
A new grad NP w/ 0 experience vs a new grad NP w/ 2 years experience in oncology in primary care? Fine Maybe Less carryover compared to ER or primary care It’s no different in PT; residency and fellowship trained PTs vs new grad PT? Not even close.
1/ Lots of variables to control for ER nurses transition really well to primary care, imo That’s what I’ve seen That’d be a great study to match up NPs w/ ER experience in primary care compared to a new grad NP w/ 0 experience I don’t think it’d be close.
i think the primary is a wrap at this point so whatever, but if you wasted your vote in a sanders/trump general i would say your dignity.
Having a background in ortho for ER was huge The providers respected my background and trusted my training for imaging, triage, and the like It paid off dividends as it does for primary care Hence why I see the majority of the ortho cases.
As competitive as PA school is right now, many of them have experience as RNs, paramedics, pharmacy technicians and the like Training is not the same thing as actually practicing as an RN My ER experience as an RN was invaluable to my primary care practice As it is for others.
the original point i was making to you is that bernie supporters welcome you and the conversations you want to have regarding ubi i think this conversation proves that point just remember that on your primary day, and in november when we win because we’re going to.
Can someone please send me a laptop sticker that says “Do not approach me unless you voted for Hillary in the primaryhot felons excluded who were locked up at the time for some type of Departed situation” for use in Chicago coffee shops.
This democratic primary is so nasty These mfs acting like children.
So you don’t think it was at all aggressive to respond to me saying “bend the knee or go for trump We don’t want your vote anyway”?  There’s record gop primary turnout for trump Maybe focus your ire on that, not liberals who just “aren’t sure” about Bernie.
Happy Sunday @BernieSanders has now won the first 3 of 3 states this primary season  #msnbcmeltdown.
If you need further proof that tons of us exist literally every person who showed up to primary vote/caucus for someone other than Bernie has said they support the democratic establishment but “dunno” about this Sanders guy.
What scares me about all of these primary “dreams” is what good are they without a majority in *both* the House and Senate?   The Dems had 60 Senators from 2009-11 and barely passed the ACA   Also, unless they remove McConnell every bill dies with him.
Folks said this about Trump Let’s not  get out over our skis now And let’s let the primary process actually play out https://twittercom/morningmoneyben/status/1231399150752804866 ….
I actually dropped @amyklobuchar from my list of primary possibilities when I saw her demeanor towards @PeteButtigieg during the last debate She couldn’t “presidentially” handle the heat.
In a primary as competitive as this one, if you all got blown out this bad, you’ve gotta reconsider why you’re still in the race   Like yo, you’re wasting a lot of people’s time and money.
hey, he has won each primary, even though they’ve only been pluralities not majorities it will be interesting to see if his vote share increases as candidates drop out, of if the race is bernie vs everyone else i don’t think we can really know which is correct as of now!.
He’s yet to crack 30% in a primary vote.

Please just switch parties and primary Trump The @GOP base appreciates Russian-style propaganda and deep fakes like this one.
Splitting the vote is not how it works You are aware it’s a primary and then a separate general election?.
Republicans because this primary is an absolute mess.
Getting a routine physical check at the doctor’s today, an maybe this will become my primary care doc too Going multiple unknown years here without a check up or a primary care doc is not a good thing I may add Silly me Glad I am putting a stop to that today #Health.
So is a ton of his supporters not voting for the nominee if they pick someone with less votes and delegates in the primary It cuts both ways They can do it, but don't act like there won't be consequences.
Y’all better keep this same energy about Bloomberg if he somehow makes it out of the primary.

Ah, I voted no for thé primary.
If there is one issue that they all agree on, it's that Trump is bad It's a primary debate, not a DNC fundraiser -- no room for kumbaya here.
Everyone needs to vote to reaffirm and define their rights on a continuous basis  I guess that's it, I see the key fights to be freedom of speech/press, freedom from religion, and a right to healthcare I have the convenience that gay rights are not a primary concern for me now.
Maybe Bernie should have entered the Democratic Socialist Party primary and do their debates instead of mooching off the Democratic Party to promote his brand.
This is specifically for the primary, right?.
@ewarren is my favorite candidate but I just don’t feel like she will win this primary #torn.
OMG me too I sat in the corner at the first event I staffed @JacobForClerk at tonight hoping that no one would speak to me until I got myself together We only have 26 days left until the primary It gets better!.
Agreed but this is our primarywe hv to pick the best  candidate  Kumbaya is ova.
