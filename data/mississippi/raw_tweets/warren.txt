well… currently #ewarren seems to align herself more with Bloombergat least judging by her attack ads against Bernie.
Why do so many gay males follow him?   Closet case misogynists? Why did he mentioned that a women couldn’t become president? He wasn’t supportive of @ewarren,  Sanders can eat doo-doo and retire  I love Warren for her plans & action, but am leaning heavily to Biden for the win.
fucking hate this guys guts but he’s literally fucking right warren should have swallowed her pride and put her ego aside to bring progressives together spite and money are very powerful it seems https://twittercom/realDonaldTrump/status/1235223911538872323 ….
I have said this over and over The moderate Republicans and indep that I know, many because I am in a conservative business, will never vote for sanders or warren Our best best is Biden or Bloomberg.
