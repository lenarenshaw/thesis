Had the chance to hear @ewarren at @sxsw in 2019 From that moment I knew she would be the next POTUS With 20 days to go until the South Carolina primary, ready to finish this journey in South Carolina strong  #20days #WinWithWarren #SCforWarrenpictwittercom/fZXc4r8ouu.
@ewarren South Carolina is the last line of defense for Warren's campaign She must take this state It's too consequential South Carolina is like Obama's Iowa, when we got the black vote's confidence to get behind Obama Warren must win this from Bernie & Biden We've got this!.
klobuchar has debate momentum; warren has debate regrets; desperate biden says buttigieg is no obama, and that he'll probably lose again but south carolina and blacks matter sanders will probably win, so second to fifth really matter and here we are, two days til new hampshire.
This is stupid  Aside from being a ridiculously narrow ticket, sanders is way ahead and warren may not get past south carolina.
@ewarren can crack all the snide jokes she wishes The fact is she, and Biden, are battling to see who will finish in 4th vs 5th place in New Hampshire tomorrow   With more very poor showings coming up in Nevada and S Carolina -  Once March gets here, Warren will be out https://twittercom/bennyjohnson/status/1226990672156209158 ….
Why would it be Bernie vs Pete? I could see Biden winning South Carolina and Nevada and then Bloomberg winning 5 or 6 states and warren winning 1 or 2 states too on March 3 It’s going to be a 4 or 5 person race after Super Tuesday which is unheard of.
Amy warren Biden under 15%in new Hampshire  pete down too If warren and amy dint get 15% they should get out and give their votes to Bernie if they refuse they will never win nevada south carolina and beyond https://twittercom/rmc031/status/1226625944825319426 ….

The yougov poll? I wouldn't take that seriously, it's always been overly kind to warren So far warren took 3rd in iowa and was 4th and non-viable in the next two states South carolina isn't going to be any kinder to her.
Senator @ewarren delivers some bad news to the crowd in Denver: Today, I can't stay and do selfies I have to go to South Carolina   "Here's my promise," Warren said, telling the crowd if they deliver CO for her, she'll come back for selfies with everyone.

a larger fraction than I'd like them to be! it's fine, bernie will win nevada and south carolina and basically every super tuesday state and warren will drop out and endorse him and everyone will acknowledge him as the frontrunner and the one who will beat trump.

I've abstained myself from making these comments but today I ask @ewarren to drop out and endorse @BernieSanders if she does bad in Nevada and South Carolina We need to win this and Super Tuesday is a big part of that Bloomberg is getting too close and we need to defeat him.
Its a 4 way race with sanders having slight lead over biden who if he wins south carolina will be come back kid prt2, then bloomberg and warren who will win hom state leaving her in race for awhile after super tuesday.

Nevada and South Carolina will we up deciding her fate unfortunately I also have a pretty good feeling Biden and/or warren will be dropping out before or during Super Tuesday.
Elizabeth Warren had a worse-than-expected showing in New Hampshire, and she needs a Facing The Giants-like moment if she wants to regain momentum going into Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday #LFG #Warren2020 #TeamWarren https://justinspoliticalcornertumblrcom/post/190809329257/elizabeth-warren-isnt-done-yet …https://wwwvoxcom/2020/2/12/21134430/elizabeth-warren-nevada-super-tuesday ….

absolutely i think that if both tulsi and warren drop, then that could seal up a sanders nomination obviously tulsi is much more likely to drop out soon, but hopefully warren underperforms in nevada and south carolina and sees the writing on the wall.
strong fourth for warren! “so look, i gotta tell ya, i’m still with ya fighting and taking selfies in our strong grassroots movement we will keep fighting for big structural change in south carolina!”.

My original plan was to wait for the South Carolina primary and vote for the winner BUT we have to mail our ballots in for Super Tuesday and it wouldn't get there in time SO I've voted for @ewarren and am mailing my ballot today Mom and I also donated to her campaign Ta-da.

Warren is polling 4th in Nevada, 5th in South Carolina and predicted to lose her home state, and she still hammering Bloomberg She scared of the Bernie Bros and she wants to be Bernie’s VP https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1230676793801220097 ….
@amyklobuchar @PeteButtigieg @joebiden @MikeBloomberg @ewarren For the sake of our country, we desperately need for only one of you to emerge out of South Carolina, and into Super Tuesday against Bernie Sanders If you five split delegates between yourselves, none of you.
If warren finishes 3rd in Nevada it would be an upset South Carolina she is lucky to get 4th She is dead in the water Trump campaign wants the Dems to continue cannibalizing each other Last debate was a trump win Can they do again next week?.
I think warren is going to surprise some people in South Carolina.

Veterans and Military Families with Warren is bringing the fight for big, structural change to South Carolina this weekend If you’re a veteran or military family member, join our grassroots movement http://ewarren/vetsandmilfams .
@RogerLau @ewarren  One of the pundits mentioned that EW doesn't have a significant org in South Carolina to mobilize black voters If true, what are we doing to change that? (I'm all in for Warren!).
@ewarren if Bloomberg is starting to talk about VP choices, you should do the same especially before South Carolina and @AndrewGillum would be a great choice & put SC and FL in play!.
I made phone calls for @ewarren today ahead of the South Carolina primary We had an amazing turnout! Smart, kind, upbeat people One thing I've found is that every time you put yourself out there, you end up talking to someone who tells you something you needed to hear (1 of 2).
I voted early in the North Carolina democratic primary for @ewarren today I believe in her plan for America as well as her leadership If you're undecided for the primary and interested in my opinion, feel free to DM me and I'd love to discuss my views with you Go vote!!!!.
I spent my Valentine's Day going to early vote for @ewarren in the North Carolina Democratic Presidential Primary .
