This comes down to our very odd political primary system Unless you’re a billionaire you have to focus your attention on the very white states of Iowa and New Hampshire It feels like the attention of most non billionaire candidates is focused in those two states.
Voters in New Hampshire will hit the polls in the nation’s first 2020 primary election on Feb 11  What are Democrats in the state thinking after the latest debate? https://wburfm/3achAdw .

If the Presidential primary did not start an absurd two years too early, there would be more excitement now & minorities would have lasted until at least New Hampshire! In 1992 everyone lasted! Ironically political consultants will advise against this because they want their pay!.

I wish!! I’m in New Hampshire so we have less than a month until primary day and as someone who has never booked a show before I know I would need over a month to execute this but honestly, inspiring, and I sent the flyer to all my NH for bernie volunteer friends for morale boost.
