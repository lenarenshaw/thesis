Harris or warren https://twittercom/WajahatAli/status/1231485063986122757 ….
I am a lifelong Democrat  @ewarren is certainly NOT what I am looking for!.
If bloomburg wants to win he will have to become a champion of the left and that means he needs to attack trump,  this slightly humorous stuff wont win votes   He needs to hire elizabeth warren to design attacks on trump and big oil for him.
Well warren left bloomburgs ass well done,  and not even trumps ketchup could make it edible.

@ewarren, please explain to me how rehashing stories about Bloomberg's NDA's helps Democrats beat Trump or defeat the Russian influence in our elections? Stop the infighting & start focusing on the issues Most of us are exceedingly worried about Trump's actions in re:DOJ, DNI.
elizabeth warren’s “righteous indignation” crumbles now that she has flipped on both allowing super delegates to undermine the democratic process of “who gets the most votes wins” + taking super PAC money when she based her campaign on anti-corruption.
I really don't care for her doing that at all There are more important issues like beating Trump This infighting is a turn off to me I just cant vote for her in the primary Warren Goes After Bloomberg Again, Offers Contract To Release Women From NDAs https://wwwhuffpostcom/entry/bloomberg-warren-nondisclosure-agreement-releases_n_5e4f6c17c5b6b82aa650b010 ….
Not to worry, warren's campaign is dead, only reason she is in it is by the narrative of leftist MSM.
yeah sorry warren has absolutely lost it https://twittercom/Yamiche/status/1230354408707371008 ….
Bernie and warren,   Bloomburg and klobuchar, Biden and a nice hospice nurse.
In regards to debate last night you should have said warren recently lost staff due to hostile work environment I bet your  workplace lawsuits are statistically insignificant if you compare to total Bloomberg employee population  Bring this up in next debate.
It’s not over More angry Warren please  https://wwwcosmopolitancom/politics/a31022050/elizabeth-warren-debate-anger/ ….
Barista who was for Yang who last week said she was considering @MikeBloomberg after seeing tons of ads for him on SnapChat just told me she saw him in the debate and he totally lost her (both by being so obviously unprepared and from @ewarren beating the shit out of him :).
She may have lost my support in the primary but still it’s hard not to like @ewarrenhttps://twittercom/mj_lee/status/1231005553737920515 ….
I watch you all the time @Lawrence   I am a lifelong Democrat  But I was turned off watching @ewarren cross-examine Mayor Bloomberg  Does she believe she was persuasive?  How does the existence of a couple of NDAs amount to anything given what is going on in this country?.
man if elizabeth warren was a communist i would all the fuck about it.

#DemocraticDebate what are the values of the dem party? What does it mean being dem? a bunch of old white men throwing shade on each other? ( @MikeBloomberg does deserve a lot of shame) but beyond that it proved that @ewarren is the most intelligent woman, wow! #Warren2020 .
