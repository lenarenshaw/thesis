pete buttigieg accepts financial backing from youtube and uses it to slander the good name of “lo-fi hip hop radio: beats to relax/study to” too polarizing, he says “why not listen to the beatles instead”.
The speed with which centrist liberals switched from buttigieg to klobuchar to Warren to Bloomberg via contested convention to sheer grief that Sanders is going to win in just this week?  Poetic cinema.
Can Pete buttigieg be annexed from the gay community?.
There were dozens of math errors They favored buttigieg and hurt Bernie Some precincts didnt report the right results With a quick recanvass the gap has been closed by 97% They're gonna do a recount after which they can correct the math errors so it's very likely Bernie wins.

Lo que pasa es que en las primarias democratas,cuando hay un empate en los precintos,eligen el ganador al azar, en este caso sacando cartas (Nevada) xdEntonces en ese local buttigieg sacó los mismos votos que bernie sanders pero por una carta terminó llevandose el local completo.
After the recanvass, Buttigieg's lead is at 08 SDE However, math errors can only be addressed with a recount, and both of their campaigns have now requested recounts (in 10 precincts for Bernie, 14 for Buttigieg)   https://wwwpoliticocom/news/2020/02/18/buttigieg-sanders-iowa-recanvass-gap-115898 …https://wwwpoliticocom/news/2020/02/21/iowa-caucus-precincts-recount-116624 ….

buttigieg's running for the same reason gabbard was running; he can't win a statewide election in his home state, so rather than sticking around and doing the work, he wants to jump the turnstile and cut in line.

the fact that kevin has tweeted Nothing w/ the names of any of the candidates leads me to believe so  the rest are also accurate scott being for buttigieg is too easy so i'd say he was loosely pro-yang and now just swims over to whatever ship he thinks isn't gonna sink.

i understand the sentiment, but alienating a group of people (warren supporters) will not bode well for sanders if warren ends up dropping out of the race with buttigieg and klobuchar dropping out, the split in the progressives is already a disadvantage.
