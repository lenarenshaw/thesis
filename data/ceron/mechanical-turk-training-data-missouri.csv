I have a lot of questions about Bloomberg using Obama in his ads,missouri
"Trumps also put some of his money to good use, but a lot of it has been put to bad use   Mike bloomberg is no different",missouri
"Sir do you not feel the fear in most of US? The country is burning....being destroyed by these traitors!  You and the other leaders in Dem Party need to get together, get the ex Presidents and lead US in mass demonstrations!  #Resist",missouri
No thanks to both of those names. I like Yang because he can reach both sides.,missouri
"Indeed, but we read from left to right, not vice versa, and Bernie had to rise one place if Biden has fallen two places.",missouri
Hell no. There will be ads on black  radio how racist  Bloomberg was/is to suppress turnout. If he gets nominated the campaign  will be who is most racist. Ppl will get totally disgusted,missouri
he really wanna touch the bloomberg,missouri
The media sees that biden is toast. So they escalate bloom to suppress Bernie.,missouri
"Bloomberg is a capitalist only when it concerns himself, but socialist when it comes to everything else (though not as extreme as Sanders).",missouri
The eventual Dem Nom may be too weak to defeat Trump.,missouri
CNN is like the obsessive boyfriend who won't let go of the ex (Biden). Let it go! @Bakari_Sellers @KirstenPowers @andersoncooper @JenGranholm,missouri

Any Democrat for President,missouri
You are the only politician less like able than joe Biden.,missouri
Bloomberg at least isn't a filthy socialist.,missouri
But Bloomberg has pledged his money and resources to whoever the nominee is it's very sad that people are saying Bloomberg based on a bunch of TV ads because he hasn't even debated,missouri
