klobuchar has debate momentum; warren has debate regrets; desperate biden says buttigieg is no obama, and that he'll probably lose again but south carolina and blacks matter sanders will probably win, so second to fifth really matter and here we are, two days til new hampshire.

I think South Carolina will pick Bernie as well They sure as heck won't pick buttigieg Hoping Yang can get his numbers up, even a bit Slow and steady wins the race.
That could be a particular liability in South Carolina, where more than half the Democratic primary electorate is black #MarijuanaNews #KushClickshttps://thehillcom/homenews/campaign/482134-abc-moderator-presses-buttigieg-on-rising-arrests-of-blacks-on-marijuana ….
what are these odds for bloomberg about? he hasnt won anything? so just curious what the betting markets see that has him above buttigieg? and Bidens done for  and will most likely pull plug after south carolina.
i will be absolutely shocked if buttigieg doesn't flame out once we get to south carolina, maybe even nevada dude has legitimate skeletons in his closet with race and i don't see how he's supposed to build a coalition to win.
