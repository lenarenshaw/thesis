When Bernie comes to NY for our primary he needs to get Cardi B, Romeo Santos, Fat Joe, Remy Ma, and every NYC based artist needs to do a show at United Palace Add some sazón to the melting pot.
I believe they are both awesome athletes My point was based on the number listed for Hill since that was not his primary position on the field.

If the @TheDemocrats do not immediately disavow Mike Bloomberg, a Republican, and prevent him from primarying as a Democrat, I will not be voting #bluenomatterwho   I won't be voting blue at all   #BoycottBlue.
Yes, it's "open" that Undeclareds can vote in either primary I have changed from Undeclared to a party, then back again on the day of election I'm not sure whether you can change from GOP to Democrat on day of the primary.
Jesus can all Dems stop bashing each other and all agree #BlueNoMatterWho? I'm not voting for Bernie in the primary but saying this is just as bad as the Bernie bros We need to all UNITE no matter what, please stop.
Fun Fact: Bloomberg doesn't even show up on Google's results for the NH primary.
And watching FoxNews covering the democratic primary is #sofun #BernieIsTheFix.
Go try to steal a primary and get caught, grifter.
Who of these four (middle candidates) do you think will score highest in New Hampshire's First In The Nation primary tonight?.
It makes little sense to leave a party and continue to vote for it even with a better alternative Consider an independent in this primary  If not, the incumbent wins Voting Republican in the primary ensures an incumbent (Democrat) win  https://ballotpediaorg/California%27s_46th_Congressional_District_election,_2020 … helps.

#NHprimary #FITN, Amy Klobuchar knows how to effect change throughout the entire political and economic system  It's called systemic change, actually  Only a pragmatic progressive like her, someone not wedded to ideology, could accomplish this    The right experience counts!.
you know I’ve really been thinking hard about who to vote for in the primary do I give my vote to a progressive? or a moderate? a man? or a woman? after many months of deliberation, I have finally decided I will vote for the candidate who gets riff raff to follow me again.
Not true Bernie primary voters had the highest turnout for Hillary of any other dem primary voter in 2016 Voter apathy is how we got Trump There are a lot of Bernie voters who act a whole lot like MAGA voters online, but they are engaged and will show up to the polls.

Her campaign staff deserves to be shot out of a cannon They took a promising progressive campaign and turned it into the sleaziest smear machine in this entire primary.
Between Sanders and Bloomberg only I would honestly vote "No Preference" at this point (an actual option on Montana primary ballots).
I'm in PA too! I plan on registering Independent after our primary I actually recently read an article that there are some Senators trying to pass legislation to allow Independents to participate in elections without being registered to either party.
Unfortunate that this happened on the day of the NH primary That means coverage of the withdrawals, which is huge news, will get buried and probably forgotten within the next few days, like 90% of all Trump outrages.

Well here's where we get into semantics, right? Is calling something "primary," thereby "putting almost all the emphasis" on it? Especially in an election year, in the midst of primaries?   Similarly, does labeling an issue "preeminent" mean no other issues matter?.
Buttigieg was far more likely to be deemed “about right” on the scale of too liberal, about right or not liberal enough in his positions on the issues, according to preliminary exit polls results among Democratic New Hampshire primary voters 1/2 https://twittercom/postpolitics/status/1227380471996264454 ….

Okay, yes, I phrased that poorly I realise that the reserves isn’t the primary argument, but I think it is correct that current (conventional) reserves are insufficient to reach RCP85.

True enough I really like Simone  And think she did a great job  Would she have expected a man to mentor her mor than KAte?  It sucks that the one time kate put her on primary service the one asshole primary guest had a hard on for her .
13% is the base number who became Democrats to try and alter Democratic nominee is the exact increase in voters percentage except Democrats vote blue no matter who Join as a Democrat they will vote Republican after primary they did the last time.
Because there were only 3 or 4 people in the primary in 2016 So yahe had more support and would have had a larger national percentage  Such spin!!.
Well I voted for @SenWarren in the #NHprimary today  I don’t really like either one of those men but I can’t stand Bernie so I guess Bloomberg it is .
Ok back it again who won the New Hampshire primary.
The DNC thought a republican in the Democratic primary was a great way to steal votes from trump.

Watch the @YelloPain video if you're afraid of a far left democratic candidate winning the primary  But the inevitable watering down of promises of free health care and debt forgiveness is much better than promises of racism and a path to authoritarianism.

Joe Biden & Elizabeth Warren tied for 4th place Both not having a good week #NHprimary2020.
Consensus among NH primary voters is that the impeachment circus didn't affect Trump's reelection chances  If that isn't an admission of failure I don't know what is.
That and the rest of the country is just tired of the Mueller stuff at this point, but I agree impeachment and Democratic primary race is now taking up much more oxygen.

more important than who wins the NH primary tonight is the overall turn-out numbers  If turn-out remains average, or low like in Iowa, that will be a troubling predictor at a time when energy against trump should be at an all-time high.

Biden is heading to South Carolina as we speak to make sure Pete doesn’t get a single black vote in that primary He’s campaigning for Bernie, basically.
I don't necessarily think that is true Contest is between Bernie and Not Bernie  As long as there is enough Not Bernie in each primary to deny Bernie a first ballot controlling delegate count, it doesn't matter which of the Not Bernies is up in each round.

Don't fear, just get behind Bernie He was the only one who couldn't have beaten trump in 2016 and the DNC blew it They had to corrupt the primary This time, it's either the one who can beat trump or four more years of trump It's a choice we all must make! I choose #Bernie.
They're going to primary in four years.

All I'm saying is if that's what's happening they might be able to do it  I'm not making any judgement on if that's going on or not or if it's even happening that Republicans are voting in the democratic primary  I'm just pointing out that logistically it's possible.
In this case, journalist’s claims (slanders) were about a book That’s a primary source, anyone can check for themselves, to judge accuracy/fairness of claims  But you’re right, when we have no access to anon ‘sources’ claimed by reporters, there’s no means to hold accountable.

Trump was able to win 2016, particularly the primary, largely because of his status as a celebrity  Bernie is the only person running in the Dem primary who is a celebrity in his own right The dude is a rockstar I think it's a huge asset for him, underrated by the pundits.

I’ll vote in the primary but if my candidate does not win the D nomination, I’ll vote for candidate who does win.

Here's some truth Trump got TWICE as many votes running as incumbent in the New Hampshire primary in 2020, than Obama did doing the same thing in 2012 People LOVE President Trump, and recognize his many accomplishments The excitement is palpable Can't say that about ANY Dem.

I love teaching in the primary grades for so many reasons; not working in a traditional grading system is on that list Having the freedom to examine student work for the sole purpose of determining where the learning goes next is so energizing and efficient!.
In '08, I walked in to see that the "ic" in "Democratic" had been marked through the party's instruction sign at my precinct  I complained to the poll worker who told me a man voting in the GOP primary told HER it shd be this way so she changed it 1/2 pictwittercom/17tEMLNSIi.
I'm with @ewarren, and I hope she wins the primary  But I will vote for whomever wins the primary, even if it's Sanders, for whom I have no desire to vote.
Honestly, her platform sounds as if she should be running in a primary against McConnell, not running on a Dem ticket.

Just IMHO but it's a primary and primaries are competitive (see: 2016) We don't have to like everything said but no reason to go *too* hard at a sinking competitor we might need as an ally in weeks Should prob at least hold off & revisit after SC to see where things stand.

hillary actually wanted trump to win the primary too  didn't go too well and he's talking behind the scenes that "socialism" isn't easy to beat  i think bernie might be the only one capable of putting up a fight in the general, the rest of them are bad against him.
Easily the funniest moment of the primary so far has been when Chris Matthews made up the 100% arbitrary “only vote for someone that would save you from a car” standard and then just said Bernie didn’t pass his fictional test  The next day we find out he did save someone.

Correct The primary goal has to be making sure the Dem nominee does not rile up the Trump base and flip Independents to him.
Seems like the inverse of what (at least some of) his supporters said 4 years ago, which was essentially "we're going to do what we can in the primary to make him the nominee, then rally around Clinton in the general if she wins" Now we all need to get behind him immediately?.
Our moral system is a mishmash of primary, secondary and tertiary values and indicators In the confusion this creates, non-primary values can be elevated into primary status This isn't ideal, but it is understandable (Realizing now this is a bit of a tangent wrt your tweet).

The media actually mostly ignored AOC leading up to her primary, and she needed to build grassroots support instead of relying on media coverage  AOC gets attention now, because she is very competent and productive compared to similarly left wing politicians in congress.

Renewed my car insurance If I added my 19 year old son my cost goes up $1,100 If I add him as primary drive it goes from $2,344 to $5,700 #ICBC makes it impossible for most of his generation to drive They are the first generation forced into car share & Ubering #Canadapictwittercom/Mj1DpH3ga0.
Share your concern  BS has made a couple of statements of avoiding internal fighting but needs to do WAY more How many of the "negative progressives" are bots or genuine??  I like the phrase  You fall in love with your candidate in the primary You fall in line x election.
demanding people talk about voting today on the general for a man who has no delegates and hasn't been on the ballot, is entirely out of order it's one of the weird mind traps used to dodge his limited appeal to primary voters.
I will tell u from my first hand experience that difference Bernies volunteers I worked with in 2016 (supported in primary) to Hillary’s (general) was the overall decorum and respect Bernie became far more negative attack/trump like and it turned me away from support this time.
Where on earth are you getting "because the cases are mild for the first go around" from? You might want to chat with some of the patients in hospitals for weeks on their first "go around" It looks like primary infection causes a cytokine storm, ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Honestly @TheDemocrats @TomPerez @BarackObama @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer how can you be letting this man into the party primary???  He’s a total disaster  There is ZERO chance he gets dem voters to the polls in November in the numbers needed to beat Trump  ZERO chance https://twittercom/BenjaminPDixon/status/1229472800194416640 ….
He's not the first politician to switch parties  Bernie only registered as a Democrat to run in our primary.
You don’t get! Some people find Bernie intolerable! They are going to support whoever they think can beat him! I’d prefer Just about anyone to Bloomberg, except Bernie! I’ll vote for Warren or Klobachaur in my primary but if it comes to it I’m never Bernie !.
omg i thought so but honestly i can’t even tell anymore with this bizarre primary season.
I'll repeat This isn't about me or my comfort This is about strategy Whatever we use against each other in the primary is going to be regurgitated in the general by the GOP w/the added stamp of "well, they said it first" I understand real trauma & I get the difficulty 1/.
That defensemen had the primary assist on the one goal We need Greene but we also need more.
He literally has been telling people at his rallies to vote for bernie in the primary.
UmIT’S FEBRUARY 17 Then again, those damn things can probably withstand nuclear waror a presidential primary pictwittercom/s9xxHz83Yu.
This I’m not going to tell you who to vote for in the primary, but anybody, including Bloomberg, would be better than Mango Mussolini For one thing, he wouldn’t have an entire party helping him commit civil rights violations and perverting justice We could make him back off.
Is this a subtweet about primary season?.
I can’t wait for this primary nonsense to be over because honestly I care more that people who see this twitter ultimately see the democratic establishment party for what it is and all their nonsense That aside, my next tweet is for you .
I would never write someone in for the general, I’m speaking of the primary And that poll was old, before I knew he would still be on the ballot Damn you really stalking tho lol.
Nancy Pelosi (D) (Incumbent) Agatha Bacelar (D) Shahid Buttar (D) Tom Gallagher (D) John Dennis (R) DeAnna Lorraine (R)  A top two finish in the primary is all that is needed Dennis hasn't come close, but a female Republican has made the general election the last two years.
Ur not getting it That’s for the general When we get there obviously every dem and sane person is voting for dem candidate over trump But in the primary we need to pick the best candidate that’s what gives us the best chance of winning Bloomberg is not the best candidate.
bernie isn’t winning the primary national poll mix from 538 here do you know how trend lines work? pictwittercom/GoIYbrNIWn.
I use to do it in primary school then stopped but I love doing it, trying to get back into it probably xxx.
it's variable by time-of-day  (quick enough at 2 am eastern) which makes me think load / bottleneck, so I would expect it is their database joining a bunch of relationships to hydrate the data for primary response.
How do you win the Dem primary? The same way you win the election By winning a certain # of delegates/electoral votes And you win a state by getting the most delegates/electoral votes Sanders lost the delegate race in IA and tied in NH https://twittercom/AdamSchiavone/status/1229553877265080321 ….

Trump has been telling his cult to vote for bernie in the primary, at his kkk rallies This is all rigged and apart of trump's plan.

you, Bill, have done more to sow misinformation and division within american discourse than vladimir putin could dream of doing; this is not the way to treat a primary frontrunner and one with the largest grassroots movement full of POC and queer people you claim to care about.
Just like every other demographic, there's the primary -ism.
This is a great race to measure the efficacy of local endorsement groups in a federal primary With $2-4 million on TV and the endorsement of BPC, DPA, RWCA, Durham Committee, and Simkins PAC, can Erica Smith beat the DSCC?.
Why is Bloomberg running as a Democrat instead of challenging Trump in his own party's primary? His ideas are pure GOP-- oligarch all the way! https://twittercom/davidsirota/status/1229549849122504704 ….
In my state this is the first time we have had primary voting instead of a caucus - and most people I know were ecstatic not to have to deal with the pressure from neighbors and the inconvenience Also previously, you could not vote absentee if you happened to be out of town.
"they will go Biden" are you from 2 months ago? Biden's campaign is dead and never had any sort of ground game Bernie is literally polling to win every state in the primary and has the best general electoral map in decades.
I dont know about supporting Bernie,  when Republicans are voting for him in the primary, THEN RUSSIAN BOTS are pushing for him as the weakest candidate with lots of baggage, to help Bernie win, then USE THAT BAGGAGE AGAINST HIM SO TRUMP WILL WIN THE ELECTION #VoteBlue2020#EXGOP pictwittercom/EdslExZTuw.
No, they did not go 100% for Obama, about 25% of HC primary voters went to McCain(numerous sources on this), while 12-15% of BS supporters went to Trump So that is just patently false.
This administration appears to be amplifying China as the primary geopolitical opponent of the US while maintaining radio silence on Russia  There's no reason to believe this is an accident.

Joe's just jealous that Bernie actually has supporters and has actually won primaries and caucuses Joe Biden has run for president THREE times in the last 32 years and has NEVER, EVER won a primary or caucus, so where is this "electability" bull**** coming from?.
Wait, what? But they don't find x in the primary classes How did she come across the first x in the first place?.
Yeah I'm thankful Ohio's primary is in the middle I have a chance to see a bit more of how the candidates perform before I have to cast my vote Though of course whom ever gets the nomination will get my vote in November.

Like how Obama campaigned for Lieberman after Joe had lost the Democratic primary in Connecticut to Ned Lamont in 2006 Joementum then not only turned around and helped block the public option in Obamacare, he spoke against Obama at the Republican convention in 2012.
You know, I probably wouldn't have objected if Bloomberg had decided to light half a billion dollars on fire while primarying Donald Trump That would have at least been entertaining.
I really wish it doesn’t have to be said, but Mike Bloomberg astroturfing the primary and giving your org a donation (instead of paying taxes) is not reparations.
I've never seen a Bloomberg ad and I welcome his participation in the Democrat primary process.

Her primary interest is cute girls, due to the influence of galges that she used to play during her days in junior high That's why she is prone to glomping girls and fantasizing about her relationship with them (and drooling in the process).

Presidential campaign that you are actually planning to primary for sends you a text asking for support Do you respond that you're going to or does that open a can of worms and lead to an endless stream of texts? (I'm not a fan of candidates texting, even from those I like).
if money as a concept dies, clout will somehow become the primary currency.

How are people feeling about the Kansas Senate primary? On the one hand, Marshall has an enormous financial edge over Kobach and the backing of the establishment On the other hand, Kobach is Kobach.
Nice job Bill! So glad he made the right choice endorsing @BernieSanders There's no secret that Bill doesn't like Bloomberg and the shitty job he did while he was mayor! Hopefully this can help put @BernieSanders over the top and make him win NY's primary.
Unfortunately, yes All the Biden hugs & Steyer "I just wanted to say hi to Bernie" moments reveal that these people interact in rooms together They know Bernie is actually not a bad guy They're also seeing all these progressive candidates going up to primary them everywhere.

This just in from Justice Dems Congressman Henry Cuellar is holding a fundraiser @SpeakerPelosi 4 the DCCC in Laredo, Texas just days before the primary elec on March 3rd And the Koch network just announced it’s backing its first ever federal Democrat by endorsing HCuellar.
As a bit player in this giant drama, and as a moderate independent who leans toward the Democratic Party, I am going to go with my gut and will be voting for Michael Bloomberg in the primary Sadly, I don't see any of the other candidates being effective against Ttump.
I can‘t believe anybody would post such propaganda as ‘evidence’  Pathetic  Holes can be blown in all of those assertions by THEIR OWN publications and many others  That is primary school level PR.

"Trump didn’t have a serious primary challenger" because the GOP shut everyone else out Just ask Bill Weld or Joe Walsh.
I can guarantee you that Bloomberg, Biden &Bernie would never be my 1st choice  However, I'm not sure either of my 2 favorites can win  By the time the primary rolls around, I will decide who I think has the best chance to beat dotard  In the meantime, I'll enjoy MB's tweets.
was just thinking about her and wondering if she's on the VP radar for candidates - and can we do something to curb the immense influence of two very white, unrepresentative states (one of whom should surely forfeit their primo primary spot after debacle)?.
Eh Losing the primary isn't the same as being weak against Trump Like for example You had Ronald Reagan who lost the primary in 76' only to come back in 80' and clean house And as of right now, Bernie is the front runner in the primary.
There is no “messing it up”  You’re not participating in a betting pool where you “lose” if you don’t pick the winning candidate Vote your conscience in the primary; but come the general, please vote based on what is best for the countrywhich may not be the same thing.

I’d really suggest that we all stick to a collaborative approach to #FCP around management/funding/competencies et cetera It’s a great concept but has issues; siloed working won’t work and will ultimately fail patients and primary care.
The thing I have to argue with is that there’s never really a moment that you are forced to use a primary weapon unless you are just a bad shot You get a kill, you get special ammo Even if the enemy you killed doesn’t have special, their teammate who is running special drops it.
Advocating for a candidate you believe in does not make someone part of the problem It is exactly what a primary is for  If you want to convince someone to help your cause show them the respect you would expect them to show you.
I do agree, one should ask But I think the primary problem is definitely on the airline.

Bloomberg’s stop and frisk policy basically hunting black and brown folks is a no for me in the primary and the general  Pete is dog whistling to try and win Trump voters Bloomberg is as racist and dangerous as Trump  Pete’s a bigot and also a no.
I'm voting Yang in the primary General?? Depends on who is less divisive So far not looking so good A lot of Yang Bashing ugliest - may have to write in @AndrewYang  #DNC #Democrats.
I don’t know if this is an act or not, but I’m inclined not to believe him I won’t vote for him in the primary, but if he’s the eventual nominee, then there is no choice.
Oh, ffs It's supposed to be a *Democratic primary*, and the Dem electorate has internalized to the nth degree that Trump is bad and just be defeated.
