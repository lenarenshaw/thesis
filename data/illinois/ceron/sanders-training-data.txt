he’s a very high risk candidate and trump still has a strong voter base  i think warren is the middle ground between sanders and bloomberg but america is still not ready for a woman president .

kinda scary that trump and russia wants sanders to be the democratic nominee lol.
But isn't that still better than founding a PAC yourself that is getting six figure donors directly assisting your own campaign? https://wwwsaloncom/2020/01/23/watchdog-alleges-that-political-nonprofit-founded-by-bernie-sanders-violated-campaign-finance-laws/ …  Who has taken a stronger stance against them than Warren?.

In order to defeat trump*, we have to vote for a Democratic candidate in the primary And remember, Bernie is NOT a Democratic candidate  Here’s how to stop Bernie Sanders from being the Democratic nominee https://wwwpalmerreportcom/analysis/heres-how-to-stop-bernie-sanders-from-being-the-democratic-nominee/25508 … via @PalmerReport.
Sounds like a good reason to make sure Bloomberg isn’t the nominee, bc plenty people won’t vote for him, and he’ll lose Probably better off with someone like sanders.
Democratic Primary Voters: Sanders 27%   Biden 15% Warren 14% Bloomberg 14% Buttigieg 13% Klobuchar 7%  Head to head with Bloomberg only:   Sanders 57% vs Bloomberg  37% (20 pt lead)  https://wwwnbcnewscom/politics/meet-the-press/nbc-news-wsj-poll-sanders-opens-double-digit-national-lead-n1138191 ….

Elliott (not black bernie sanders), but imma text you g.
Every candidate until they drop out says they can/will win Warren keeps trying to distance herself from sanders even though they are the two most similar, so her supporters have to find a reason to not like him And sexism is the easiest It sucks I liked them both.
@BenSpielberg I think Sanders creates more excitement/widens base I think if he isn’t the candidate a sizeable amount of his supporters won’t vote Moderates & progressives alike are going to vote D the whole way down So edge goes to sanders (Warren is my personal choice).
I think those words are unreasonable given that nobody is “dismissing her “existence”  she’s losing If there was any indication she could Not Lose, pundits would be all over it — theyre desperate for any alternative to sanders They loved warren when they thought she had a shot.

oh come on man, carville was just on your network foaming at the mouth about sanders and spreading conspiracy theories.
What plan has sanders laid out to combat Russians actively supporting his campaign? That’s right he was briefed on it and decided to ignore the information for a month until it became public.

Steyer has been making thoughtful campaign stops and actually listening to south carolinians, unlike sanders he’s got a solid chance, and win or lose, i for one am endlessly grateful for him.

nobody likes it when I casually mention that every single presidential candidate is a republican (except sanders who is basically just a democrat 100 years ago).

In what material way are you fighting? Or are you just tweeting and voting every four years? Bc all the people I know who are actually organizing on their free time are only interested in sanders if they are interested in democrats at all.
Great reason for ppl to throw their support behind sanders since he’s the front runner and they seem to be worried abt his supporters not voting.
bernie sanders texts me more than everyone else combined.
if you don’t see a difference between voting for bernie sanders and donald fuckin trump you should ask yourself a lot of questions about that conscience of yours.
i think the primary is a wrap at this point so whatever, but if you wasted your vote in a sanders/trump general i would say your dignity.
Young Bernie sanders is  my dream man?.
the bottom line is if yang supporters want to continue the ubi conversation, it’s going to be heard most under a sanders administration no other candidate would even entertain the idea a lot of bernie supporters believe in ubi, just not yang’s version of it.

Arguably sanders needs a better retort to this tho The Nordic system isn’t wholesale socialism He isn’t taking a vow of poverty in his policy stances He could use the opportunity to explain that he isn’t a socialist as most understand it for one https://twittercom/kgosztola/status/1230362225887662080 ….
Buttigieg’s HS essay on sanders is irrelevant In my junior year of HS, I wrote an essay that argued that gyms should be subsidized and tax breaks should be given based on BMI Now, at 25, I certainly don’t want to attend a government subsidized gym!.
I’m actually not holding anyone to a different standard because I’m not the one attacking other progressives for having progressive grassroots support organized into 501c4s, as if they’re big money interest groups— and neither did sanders — warren did.
we have wildly different interpretations of pete and i am insanely over amy to the point i can’t listen to her and am not interested in be convinced otherwise will i vote for her if she gets it? yes will i be as annoyed voting her as i would biden/sanders/bloomberg? yes.

If sanders didn’t have a heart attack after that performance I have faith in heart tbh.
No But that’s the picture you paint which is a huge contrast to the clarity of most of your writing Many responses to your sanders tweets clearly draw those conclusions Why do you truly believe sanders is awful?.
Accurately? Is your theory that trump and sanders are in cahoots and Bernie’s whole political career as life was a ruse to get to this point?.
I agree with you on everything you’ve said about trump But you’re wrong about sanders He has the best voting record of anyone running He supports the working class like no one has before.
Stop this Stop comparing sanders to trump They couldn’t be any more different Bernie released 10 years of tax returns Trump = 0 Bernie provided more than any other candidate: Detailed letters from 3 physicians including the Congress physician Trump had a fake doctor.
