Ok, I don't think there is any new information here I'll maybe concede this could have been better to disclose immediately, but the Washington Post sitting on it until the day before the Nevada caucus is much more nefarious, to me.

Is this wat he’s doing? when he’s yelling at reporters before getting on air force one?  We are paying for his campaign rallies? He’s going to every state that has a caucus before the dems? How’s he gonna do Super Tuesday?! Maybe he’ll golf Again #VoteBlueNoMatterWho.
Oh, please cease with the idiot's punditry We've had a caucus (he was 2nd), a white primary (he barely won) and a debate in another caucus state that he did not "win" And now we're heading for a "contested convention"? Pure BS https://twittercom/washingtonpost/status/1230674007281762305 ….
Maybe if it was a caucus, but not only is MN Amy’s home but it’s also kinda isolated on the ST map and weather could mean getting delayed.
Sanders caucuses with Democrats foe decades but was reluctant to join the party for Ita love of war and corporate welfare I can get behind that.

I like how Chris Matthews keeps saying that Bernie Sanders is a totalitarian while Trump utterly undermines the Federal government and the GOP literally cancels primaries and caucuses to support him.
This caucus stuff is pure BS  https://twittercom/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1231322635419688966 ….

Neveda caucus is in disarray, they now have issues with the voting system Don't expect anything soon #NevadaCaucus.
51% of Nevada caucus voters are new voters- this is promising! America is getting involved, way it should be .
Can we all agree that we all hope this is the last fucking caucus we ever have to deal with?.
Bernie Sanders goes after Bloomberg in final Vegas rally ahead of Nevada caucuses https://wwwusatodaycom/story/news/politics/elections/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-bernie-sanders-democrats-look-keep-gain-momentum/4830392002/ … via @usatoday.
He’s the front runner You’re helping elect trump He didn’t disclose classified intelligence information Do you really think it’s a total coincidence that this leaked the day before the caucus?.
so ask yourself if you would like to be part of the strongest,most diverse grassroots electorate coalition in modern history, or if you want to be on the outside looking in? what benefits your ubi caucus most? if strategy is your concern, it’s pretty clear.
I could be inviting some pushback here, but the sense of my social media feeds seems to be that supporters of the Sanders campaign think caucuses are great, and states that have them are acting within their democratic rights If so, good for you pictwittercom/w7pZ03Oovh – at Revolution Brewing.

If you need further proof that tons of us exist literally every person who showed up to primary vote/caucus for someone other than Bernie has said they support the democratic establishment but “dunno” about this Sanders guy.
Sanders wins Nevada caucuses, takes national Democratic lead  https://onmktwnet/2PgMhVQ .
Bernie Sanders has won the Nevada caucuses, the AP projects The win gives Sanders victories in two of the first three states to weigh in on the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination https://wwwnprorg/2020/02/22/808503311/sanders-projected-to-win-nevada-caucuses-solidifing-status-as-front-runner ….
Has anybody noticed? I've been watching CNN panel covering Nevada caucus:  The @justicedems analyst is putting the other panelists considered pros to shame She breaks it down so clearly Very impressive.

And I’m trying not to be a homer, but it’s definitely true that Bernie people are all in for Bernie and no one else but you have to mark at least 3 on the early caucus ballot.

It turns out that Bernie Sanders was the greatest beneficiary of Iowa failing to report in a timely manner  If Iowa reported on caucus night, Klobuchar likely wouldn't be in the race Buttigieg would have likely ended up winning NH.
