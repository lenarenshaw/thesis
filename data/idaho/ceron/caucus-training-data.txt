I share the same concern because I’m hearing about independents & republicans gaming the primary which was my fear when the unity and reform commission was fighting to open up primaries and caucuses to allow anyone to change affiliation on voting day We are not in normal times.
He does caucus w/Dems & votes for Dem bills But his constant attacks on Democrats, DNC & many attacks on important Democratic bills is damaging Do Bernie supporters care that his M4A bill has no chance of passing? 14/100 senators signed on Only 1/3 of Dems You need 50.
I will remember that he was falsely accused of crimes he didn’t commit, it’s not a crime to forget something, the Democrats will do whatever it takes to bring down trump, like tampering with the Iowa caucus to keep out Bernie from running, Dems are a total joke.
Was this before or after @fcjennings shaved his “caucus beard” turned stache.
Yes, I think they fucked up big time using an unproven app in their caucus But I don't think it was on purpose or corrupt There is a difference.
Ordered a Bernie tshirt, can’t wait to caucus babyyyy.
And the on days of the primary/caucus elections where they CAN'T 'cheat' easilythere WILL be 'alternate' events in the news cycle that will choke the life out of the 'good' Bernie news--everytime.

Knives out 2: Iowa caucus results.
Those are Iowa numbers and The Iowa caucus was a mess Yang is consistently polling between 4-5% on qualifying polls otherwise he wouldn’t make the debates Those are good numbers for a non rich, white, politician candidate that gets ignored by mainstream media #NHForYang.
I can't imagine his caucus is too happy like in the videos we've seen but he probably has them all tight lipped.
Im 30 and I laugh every time I hear the word caucus and my vote counts just as much as everyone else’s Hahahah this country is neat.

You mean the app that halted almost all of the momentum they would have had coming out of Iowa? That app? The one that hurt his campaign the most? So what’s your theory, they nefariously created an app to obfuscate the Iowa caucus to dowhat exactly?.
Not begging for your vote, but on other other side you have Biden who's current biggest backers bankrupted the nation in 2008 and he's still running for president There's zero accountability I live in Europe but I am spending me savings coming back to caucus for Bernie.
The parties aren't the ones who decide what states caucus and which ones primary, that's up to the States.
Caucuses are primitive and strange too watch  not to mention all the people that could not attend a caucus it’s a joke.
the day of the iowa caucus asma called me to convince her little sister to caucus for bernie and i almost cried i was like “it’d be an honor!!!!!” and it WAS.
I’m starting to think that caucus is like pep rallies in high schools - popularity contest - whoever is the loudest wins  Voting should be anonymous so as not to feel pressured by anyone #YangGang.
No you are a corrupt company made of Clintonite insiders, who helped fix the Iowa caucus.
Im well aware of his recordThis may blow your mind but when some people said they’d vote functioning adult or inanimate object over trump,we meant it  Typical bro losing an argument “your paid by his campaign!”This is how dangerous misinformation isI caucused for warren idiot.
You spoke truth to power We need more of that Run for reelection as an Independent and you will keep your House seat The GOP has rejected you so caucus with the Dems and your voice will be heard.

I went by my early voting site today (Nevada caucus), and the line was outside the building!  I will go back during the work week.
Of course, the fact that this is already a caucus to begin with is an enormous advantage to Bernie Sanders So far the rules have been heavily tilted in his favor.
I would call it voter manipulation, manipulating early voters to pick a 2nd and 3rd candidate (which does not happen to the people who go caucus in person).

Reid says Biden will do well in diverse Nevada's caucuses http://dlvrit/RQ6j72 pictwittercom/4Ro3kSydxo.
On the actual caucus night, if someone shows up and registers their first preference but then leaves, their vote won’t matter Because they didn’t actually participate This makes the rule the same for early voters.
I was at Bernie's caucus training last Monday There were 70 ppl in person and another 80 online 150 of us sitting through a 2 hour training learning caucus math Such an amazing time Ohand I will be filming my precinct.

Early voting in the Nevada caucus makes it an entirely different animal, seems to me It lets way more people participate who couldn’t attend a caucus in person It does allow non-Democrats to vote but you have to switch parties to do so, which should limit it somewhat.
If you list just a first choice (and again, you can put “uncommitted” or Bernie again in slot 2 and 3), then you’re not actually participating in the caucus It’s a caucus.
I'm not in a caucus state It's a red stronghold and as such I have no idea on the exact details on how that works.

"throwing chairs at Nevada caucus"  This didn't happen, btw.
That's as indefensible as racism I'm an Iowa voter who caucused for Sanders & this doesn't describe me MSM throttled Yang Berners in Iowa were among those contributing $$$ to Yang's campaign to help get him on that debate stage so all Americans could hear what he has to say.
The article describes how app for caucus to send in results failed But all caucus goers handmarked and signed their preference cards which were collected for the counts Each caucus can be recreated from those cards The importance of the paper trail demonstrated.
Oh we knowlike the Iowa caucus! That’s what your dear leaders tell you right? “Russia Russia Russia” is not the problem; it’s China you donkey Hope you like (rough) rice!.
The reason why an app was created in the first place is because it created a black box where a CIA led team (Buttigieg) could manipulate the results of what inherently is a transparent caucus process.
ALL Bernie has to do to get my vote is to stop attacking fellow Democrats as “untrustworthy”   But he won’t- he never brings people together - he just attacks  Even volunteers working caucus in Iowa - he attacked them too    I volunteer to help at caucus.

CNN: Contract for Iowa caucus app underscores DNC focus on security https://wwwcnncom/2020/02/14/politics/iowa-democratic-party-shadow-contract-dnc/indexhtml ….
That would be a lot of drying up based on a caucus state that he’s not staking much on, when a state that’s been his bulwark the whole time is just around the corner I’m not saying it’s impossible, just that 20% seems way too high Maybe 5%?.
That's all theoretical because he does seem to be doing well in SC polls so far That will likely change if he flames out in NV, which is very possible, but we really can't know until after the NV caucus.
He's going to win the Leavenworth caucus .
Lol she wasn’t there because she isn’t welcome in the party, the caucus or even her own state!!! .
It Wasn't Iowa's Fault! DNC "Intimately Involved" in Hillary-Linked Junk Caucus App https://wwwthegatewaypunditcom/2020/02/it-wasnt-iowas-fault-dnc-intimately-involved-in-hillary-linked-junk-caucus-app/ … via @gatewaypundit.
Not breaking 50% versus people with 100% name recognition is not a high ceiling   I don’t understand why we’re looking at polls like this when we have actual (and future) caucus results with realignments  Polls are synthetic data NV and Iowa are real.
The BC disability caucus? That’s weird and odd.
Need over 50% of party room to change the rule back They only made the change on the veneer and easy to change back unlike alp who need 2/3 caucus.

welcome to the DSA ugly woman hot spouse caucus.
It’s gonna be an interesting caucus I think the stories will be Amy and Steyer over performing, Bernie winning.
@DNC @TheDemocrats @TomPerez you need to push #Iowa to have a primary later this year and cancel the caucus results This is not democracy and the voices of Iowans have not been heard https://twittercom/Nate_Cohn/status/1228374499831275520 ….
Support public schools and stand up for your students by attending your precinct caucus Feb 25! https://edmnme/39l7kOL  #mnleg #icaucusbecause #edmnvotes #redforedpictwittercom/c1h0wtqqfW.
Yep There's something not right with Iowans being swooned over for almost an entire year and then they still don't come out to caucus!!! The numbers this year patterned 2016  Hard to believe.
