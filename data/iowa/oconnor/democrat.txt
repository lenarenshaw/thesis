If you'd checkmated me, then I wouldn't still be "making any more moves"   Learn what a term means before you use it  Getting impeached isn't winning and how much would you like to bet that there will be 0 democrat senators voting to acquit?.

He entered under false pretenses he’s a ducking leftist, globalist demon democrat.
Hugh Hewitt is literally telling Republicans to register as democrats and to infiltrate caucuses to vote for Bernie He is a Trump supporter through and through Faux Noise is singing Bernie's praises Why do you think that is? He got IMPEACHED trying to get fake dirt on Biden!!!.
Because the DNC does what’s best for the DNC, not the nation And I’m a democrat.
HJH civics class picked Andrew Yang as the democratic nominee! pictwittercom/ZrvJf9u48m.
As sad and upsetting as things are It's my sincere hope that what the GOP is doing will ignite a fire in all of us democrats to get out and vote in  every election from here on out   Congress failed us let's not fail ourself.
In the democrat caucus it kinda does.
Romney is a democrat with identity issues.
Before going to @iacaucus2020 on Monday night, I’m binging @thewestwingTV and @WestWeekly so that I can remind myself again why I still believe @AaronSorkin1 's vision of a democratic administration can still happen in my lifetime #VoteSaveAmerica #Caucus.
If a democrat wins the president election  They need to force every thing through executive orders and every strong man tactic with the basis of what’s ok, via what Trump has done and the republicans have allowed.
Curious if you notice, Trump goes after those who go after him He usually goes after individuals, but sometimes calls out the media in general What he doesn’t do is attack the regular democrat voter Even those who hate him He’s still working for them.
WE STORM THE POLLS IN NOVEMBER #RESISTANCE We start boosting ALL democrats running for open senate seats Maintain the house! #Bloomberg & #Steyer smear trump with dropping #Levidence on the internet & ads! Roll up your sleeves and get ready to take our country back!  pictwittercom/qn375pGkCD.
Most of the markets will be fine, even after Bernie's policies  Going by strict definitions, he much more social democrat than even democratic socialist  Even socialism's modern lean doesn't eliminate markets.
Better a radical socialist democrat (which there aren’t many of) than a fascist antisocial republican (too many to count).
Guess the Trump kids need to be adopted by a  democrat so they can cheat the system with no repercussions.
Shed (I won’t judge your spelling) You are entitled to your opinion I don’t judge Mine is different To me that is okay To me Democrats (lots of good people) but many look down their noses at us They don’t represent me or my ideas So I won’t vote democrat.

A poll for any of my followers who plan on voting democrat in the 2020 general election.
I just reported his tweet That is uncalled for! Though there might be assholes on both sidesI don’t believe any democrat would go that far.
@TreyGibbs28 she’s a democrat She always, always sides with them Why do you think she was chosen? Abortion she’s good with, we need to send her back to the noodle factory That’s where she belongs She’s a noodler and certainly not a Republican .
I used to vote democrat for some local offices No more I won't even vote for a democrat for dogcatcher Not until the party moves back towards the party of JFK will they get a vote of mine.
I agree The democrat party establishment is trying to get anyone but Bernie because they don’t want to become the outwardly socialist party Bernie will make them into, not to mention Trump will easily beat him if @BernieSanders is nominated.

He's a democrat It's in his nature.
This is why I prefer @ewarren over @SenSanders  She understands what's going on and has the moral clarity and conviction to address it the way it needs to be addressed Sanders is attacking the "democratic establishment" instead of attacking Putin, the RNC, RW media, and Trump https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1222550226126413824 ….
Obamacare was not a bipartisan compromise! It was a compromise between the socialist and the Marxist wing of the democrat party.
Part of his healtcare plan talks about putting pressure on drug companies to lower prices https://wwwyang2020com/policies/prescription-drug-costs/ … Unfortunatley, it would be political suicide for any democrat to explicitly criticize the trans movement so it's hard to know where candidates really stand on it.

I fall into an age group not shown here & I will NOT vote for Sanders (unless he's the only democrat left standing).
I fall in this middle chunk & Sanders would not be my choice (unless he's the only democrat left).
6 days to go until the #IAcaucus & the @iowademocrats are preparing for the "biggest turnout in modern caucus history" @IowaSOS data shows overall voter registration has declined by 43,258 people since January 2017 & active Democrats registration has declined by 21,329.
That's a possibility They will also have video of Biden pushing to cut social security and supporting the war in Iraq It's worth contemplating which will depress the democratic vote more.

Romney is a conservative democrat that doesn't know that he's a democrat He has identity issues He probably would have been in the party of FDR, not Herbert Hoover or Coolidge This I'm fairly sure.
Yes he is He can try to sugar coat it by claiming he’s a “democrat socialist” but it’s a lie Communists lie routinely to achieve their goals History is full of their lies.
I'd like to hear a democrat say how embarrassed they are that they are the party of hate, lies and deceit.

To any republicans reading this who are angry IF you still can't bring yourself to vote for a democrat, just stay home Please  I know you can't agree w/ some dem policies, but don't vote for Trump.
