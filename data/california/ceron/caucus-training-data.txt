Well Sine everyone else is doing it I'm really proud of my victory at the caucus tonight.
Saw someone say the caucus made sense back in the day because they did it in a tavern  They didn't elaborate.
Welcome to the caucus, where the rules are made up and the numbers don't matter!.
This caucus shit has me honkin' like a goose!.
His caucus crowds were strong: In size and in energy! #PeteForAmerica.
Fuck impeachment Talk about priorities They're cheating you and your supporters again I was wrong Bernie Sanders is America's Jeremy Corbyn He does appear to be too weak to do the job  Thre cheating won't stop Once out of caucus states, it'll get ignored and you'd lose https://twittercom/SenSanders/status/1225192474173460480 ….
I can imagine that meeting  Fuck guys we got to cheat better Explain why Sanders isn't screaming about paper ballots? Also be aware If this was anywhere not a caucus you would've been cheated without anyone beyond the culprits ever knowing This is how you lose the primary btw https://twittercom/bagniewski/status/1225181775170809856 ….

Democrats can't even hold a caucus much less run a Nation Lmfao.
