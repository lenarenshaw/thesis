I’m voting for Elizabeth Warren in the Florida primary.
Black South Carolinian millennials need to have some real conversations with their mamas and grandmamas before this primary Biden is not the bizness #SundayThoughts #bernie #SouthCarolinaPrimary #cnn #Election2020 #BlackTwitter.
Whataload of crap!! Apparently you were not paying attention in 2016 Clinton & the DNC delivered the  Trump nightmare on a silver platter because she refused to embrace his followers & blatantly rigged the primary She mocked them Bernie is a uniter of Dems, not a divider.
though only tangentially related to the current dem primary discourse, this is my current favorite politics-adjacent tweet so much of everything makes me regret being alive in this, the year of our lord two thousand and twenty, but not this not even close https://twittercom/emrazz/status/1231701527892570113 ….
No one ver tell me thst supporting my candidate in a primary is a waste It’s about momentum and support #WarrenForTheWinhttps://twittercom/CBSNewsPoll/status/1231609588715270145 ….
DEM associates Let's stop the panic We've just concluded the first 3 primary processes The results of who is nominated lies in our hands Let's use this power wisely and influence those voting on Feb 29 and throughout Mar Still have many rivers to cross.
I know youre right  Im just salty from a day talking to all of my dem friends from every nook and cranny of the party who seem hell bent on making sure unifying post primary is hopeless    Thank you  Sincerely  For this reminder.
Bernie Sanders is leading the 2 most important states on Super Tuesday https://wwwvoxcom/policy-and-politics/2020/2/14/21137647/2020-primary-polls-bernie-sanders-winning-california-texas ….
Why do we keep having these purity tests? We know to vote blue We should just be expressing the positive qualities of our preferred candidate and as Rachel Maddow said vote with our hearts in the primary and our heads in the general.
And the #BernieBro have turned me completely off! I will NEVER vote for Bernie in the primary!I'm #RidenWithBiden.
Your analysis of the current news cycle is indisputable Stay tuned The primary season has just begun.
We don't need a savior, we need to VOTE for our favorite primary candidate so they can win the nomination, and then VOTE in the General Election to get rid of this scourge #tRumpCrimeFamily.

There is, however, ample evidence presented to Trump & Congress that Russia IS already interfering in our Democratic primary as well as in the general election in support of Trump Bottom line: Vet your sources & #VoteBlue! Do not allow divisiveness to dampen Democratic power.
Stop lying The #DNC followed the process in 2016 #BS didn't like it 'cos @HillaryClinton crushed him in the primary w 35 MILLION more  Democrats voting for her  #BS & supporters are sounding just like #tRump they get angry & mean when someone disagrees with them.
Biden is the only candidate cut from presidential timber We have a great team of rivals for Cabinet positions American medicine saved Bernie’s life, but his prescriptions for the economy are DOA Vote Biden in your primary!.

They have to stand down for the primary election House Dems can't take every single news cycle.
So for example, if you tell an NHS worker of Pakistani origin “facts” about that country & its primary religion, all which can be “proven” with evidence  But she thinks you’re abusive, bullying & racist — and denies you health services  Facts can still be abuse, bullying.

Being the loser in a presidential primary is like being first runner up on The Bachelor Losing is actually winning #DemDebate #andrewyang #TheBachelorABChttps://twittercom/CNNPR/status/1230132400790831107 ….
Is he going to get Dr Bornstein to write that he's on the best health ever in the back of a limo and call it a day? No? Then he's probably risking his reputation for truthfulness by refusing to honor his earlier promises Even Trump can see that Hence vetting during a primary.

@MikeBloomberg has realized tonight at #DemDebate that before he campaigns against Trump, he needs to win the DEM primary.
