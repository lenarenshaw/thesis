he has almost reached planned obsolescence, like pete biden only has to stay in for south carolina, the goal is to prevent bernie from gaining momentum into super tuesday at all cost, so they can rig it for bloomberg.
if Andrew Yang had bloomberg's funds, a couple of cities would be receiving #FreedomDividend pilots.
I swear if fucking bloomberg or Steyer (but mostly Bloomberg) gets one fucking delagate in Nevada or South Carolina we're organising an other Charlottesville rally.

what are these odds for bloomberg about? he hasnt won anything? so just curious what the betting markets see that has him above buttigieg? and Bidens done for  and will most likely pull plug after south carolina.
cant wait for steyer & bloomberg to kick joe's legs out from under him in south carolina.
As I've been saying for the past week " if Biden can’t win in Nevada and South Carolina — after losing in Iowa and likely in New Hampshire — then the door opens for Bloomberg to be crowned as the Democrat with the best chance to beat Trump" https://thehillcom/opinion/campaign/482235-juan-williams-the-door-is-open-for-bloomberg ….
There’s no way he beats trump You think he’s gonna win Florida? North Carolina? Pennsylvania? There’s literally no way in hell Only way trumps getting beat is by bloomberg or buttigeg.

Its a 4 way race with sanders having slight lead over biden who if he wins south carolina will be come back kid prt2, then bloomberg and warren who will win hom state leaving her in race for awhile after super tuesday.
i hope bloomberg has some free events with premium liquor in chicago like he's doing in north carolina, daddy loves campari.

if bernie wins nevada then south carolina it's over for biden, if biden wins nevada things are gonna go his way fast, if biden wins sc it is gonna be down to those and maybe bloomberg cause he has the money, at least it gets some of his hoarded wealth into the economy.
I have exactly the same chance as bloomberg in winning South Carolina.

Also assumes biden wins south carolina and gets a mini comeback bounce 3 days later into super tuesday Assumes bloomberg will get bashed by trump ans all other candidates Just a high level directional map assuming biden recovers 2-3% nationally Total clusterf%&%* in making.
uuhhh  I'm in North Carolina and the only thing people know about bloomberg is his TV ads and the mailings he sends to supertuesday states Yes politics unfortunately is in PART a money game You really think the executives at Facebook, Cigna, and Merck R donating 4 friendship?.
if bernie can get that south carolina win bloomberg is no longer a default choice to voters.
bernie about to sweep the first three contests and lining up for second in South Carolina Will likely flip California and Texas to 2016  Only way bloomberg or anyone else take the nomination is through foul play  dems are commie party now.

bloomberg isn't running in south carolina though.
ah yes, all of those, uh, rich middle-aged black people in south carolina, supporting bloomberg out of class solidarity.
i dont think bloomberg is going anywhere he barely registered in two primaries and i expect the same for nevada and south carolina so i guess he's hoping for the greatest comeback since bill clinton in 1992 primaries i dont see that happening.
