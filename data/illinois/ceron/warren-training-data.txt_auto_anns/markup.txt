<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">@smerconish I disagree that warren won the debate Debates should be more about issues and policy to determine that winner All warren did was attack everyone so she didn’t have to answer, which she didn’t, to her electability Quite frankly she needs to be a Democrat and get out.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">*whispers* maybe not everything that happens to warren is misogyny, cuz some things are, but let’s not forget she pretended to be a poc for a significant portion of her life and the way ppl overlook that is trash and she /should/ be ignored.</MPQASENT>
