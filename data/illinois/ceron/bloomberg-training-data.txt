today jumped from good to great when my boss said, completely unprompted, “fuck mike bloomberg”.
he’s a very high risk candidate and trump still has a strong voter base  i think warren is the middle ground between sanders and bloomberg but america is still not ready for a woman president .

that’s all fair and none of us can know the future, so it’s all just gut feelings and trust i don’t think you or anyone needs to apologize for supporting who they support (except maybe if they support bloomberg or trump).
Can’t stop thinking about that time (last night) when bloomberg said people ‘could go to my website too’ and he ‘won’t be asking for money on it’ AJSJDJSSNAKSNSKAK OKAY KING.
