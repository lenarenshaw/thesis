I have a job and I’m content with my life Like I said democrat or republican means nothing to me Eff them all They don’t care about you or I.
My original tweet did not include that hashtag and I’ve never used it My comment still stands And I’m a democrat although I have no idea why that is relevant at all to this thread I speak for myself.

Any Klobuchar has no business being in the running for the democratic presidential nominee https://twittercom/CrawfordStuff/status/1226976994866405377 ….
Must read from @mtaibbi — this really puts the state of the Democratic Party in perspective as we head into tomorrow’s #FITN primary https://wwwrollingstonecom/politics/politics-features/iowa-caucus-democrats-disaster-trump-sanders-949655/ ….
Plus, unless you can see all of America with your naked eye then you’re not going to see when it happens The difference is, protesters at dems  rallies are asked to leave in a respectful way, democrat protestors at trump rallies, attacked and harassed even at the presidents will.
Prove that one of your democrat-socialist candidates can win in the electoral collegePROVE IT!.
We are now in the phase of the democratic primary where we attack other candidates for making obviously joking statements  Congrats, Democrats  We’ve rendered Russian disinformation redundant.
ROBERTif you even try to sell me a "democrat-socialist" candidate, that's unrealistic, a losers proposition that cannot possibly win, and keeps THE HATED BEAST in office for AT LEAST 4 more years! So tell me really what you need to tell me right now, or go away! https://twittercom/johnlundin/status/1226510659116044288 ….
Well,I just want to say to all the the "democrat-socialist" supporter resisters unable to read polls or understand the electoral college or actual elections, best not try to attack a lone RESISTER ever again, EN MASSE, LIKE LAST NIGHT  Other resisters here didn't LIKE it AT ALL.
It’s not ageist to be concerned about Bernie and Biden’s ability to serve The health and transparency of candidates is a serious issue Elizabeth Warren on the other hand was the first candidate to release medical records: https://wwwhuffpostcom/entry/elizabeth-warren-medical-records-democratic-primary_n_5de991b1e4b0d50f32b100dc …https://twittercom/chucktodd/status/1226542225443737602 ….
Advise everyone to listen to @SenWarren's response to a Jewish Israel hater in NH before condemning or applauding Her intention to avoid attending AIPAC reveals she is courting anti-Israel voters Watching User Clip: Warren on AIPAC, Israel @CSPAN https://wwwc-spanorg/video/?c4853384/user-clip-warren-aipac-israel ….
If Mitt condemned career felons like Biden and Clinton, who used their offices to get millions for family gain, I'd feel more kindly   Unfortunately, he just seems  to be playing to be on the cover of Time, and to be more relevant than he really is: Junior Senator from Utah.
I believe in a woman’s right to choose And I believe in treating people well after they’re born too So do dem candidates.
Thanks for that! Gay or not,  @PeteButtigieg is a moderate, centrist Democrat and his positions predictably reflect that It seems fair that climate, immigrattion, BLM, + LGBTQ activist groups demand that he engage openly w their VALID concerns during the campaign.
