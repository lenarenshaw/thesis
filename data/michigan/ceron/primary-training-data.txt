Yeah, but unfortunately the current primary system is based off of momentum, and Tulsi won less than 1% of the vote in Iowa and only 3% in NH She’s not gonna be in any future debates, limiting her outreach, and overall voters don’t like her There’s no viable path for her.
Debate about to begin between state Rep Dan Brady and his GOP primary opponent David Paul Blumenshine pictwittercom/TQdPj1pUVv.
This is so deeply concerning It’s getting almost zero media attention, and the skewed primary results could force a Democratic candidate to withdraw from the race This is straight up *election rigging* Un-American to the core.
All I want for my birthday is a great result for @PeteButtigieg in the NH primary!.
Thank you!  She's my first choice too  Our primary isn't until May.
