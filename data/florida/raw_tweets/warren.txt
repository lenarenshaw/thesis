Stfu You have no right to talk about him You need to get out yourself This Pete support is voting for #Biden now in the primary! https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1234266283992133632 ….
oh hell yeah i know it seems weird to us but for a lot of normie voters, pete appears to be the new-young-change progressive, it makes sense a lot of his support would go to sanders and warren now we just need warren to drop and it becomes a clear progressive vs conservative https://twittercom/Robillard/status/1234255292088668160 ….
This assuming it’s just biden vs bernie A model with Biden vs bernie and warren probably has biden on top.
i support them too warren my number 1 choice  and ima proudly vote for bernie if he wins the nom too  #blueWave.
It's really sad that @ewarren has completely destroyed any respect many people including myself once held for her She was my number one for the beginning of the primary and it's sad to see her stoop so low :/.
Yet he’s the only besides warren to push for universal healthcare, having the most diverse supporters, and not defending segregation like Biden.
he recognizes all their problems except for warren who he supports funny that.
Yeah trump is fasho going to win if warren gets the Democratic nominee.
Can't wait to see what Amy Klobuchar's burner account posts, @ashleyfeinberg https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1234266283992133632 ….
Whose fault is that The answer is insane sanders supporters They blew it up Now it wouldn’t surprise me is warren doesn’t want to help him A lot of hard feelings there.
apparently liz warren's mom also told her it was bad to take super pac money and she just took it as fact for so many years until.
But klobuchar and warren should stay in? Their best showings were 3rd place, once each.
Warren is a lawyer Does that answer it? She is an institutionalized elitist in disguise as a progressive #ewarren.
I get the Bernie and trump but not the warrenwhy?.
I said Liz warren for shits and giggles .
I’m hoping he gets the dem nomination  Bernie is a shit and warren is a bigger shit    Already voted for Trump.

@ewarren @SenWarren @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer What is the difference between Sen Warren and @realDonaldTrump, when Warren stoops SO LOW so as to insult her fellow Candidates about the smallest issues It is NOT A GOOD LOOK on any Democrat Stop embarrassing us.
Just early voted for @ewarren in the Tennessee Primary!  pictwittercom/FHtbGelYjk.
great job @ewarren  ummm earth to Liz  BERNIE is leading not Bloomberg.
A fraction and 1000x more whining about it   bottomline voters are voting now and warren is not getting enough support to be viable period  no matter how much twitter works and msm keeps not wanting to believe it.
The billionaire that leftists have been warning you about was Bloomberg  This rich “social engineering” mofo wants to control every aspect of our lives  Not the DON  Audio: Bloomberg slammed Warren as 'scary' and demeaned his endorsement of Obama https://newsyahoocom/audio-bloomberg-slammed-warren-scary-023635538html ….
I trust her too And I haven’t been freaking out about it I never expected her to endorse anyone I’m just saying it’s not an unreasonable thing for Bernie supporters to hope for If the roles were reversed I’m quite sure warren supporters would want Bernie’s endorsement.
Next year is going to be really interesting when all the people who called warren voters the same as trump supporters and/or said we don’t care about anyone suddenly need staff and volunteers for city elections.
Very interested as to why Elizabeth warren hasn’t endorsed anybody yet .
Please name one thing Biden and warren agree on policy wise Quick.
@EddieTrunk during the Pearcy interview when you asked about new music  he said I’m writing  warren’s writing  how did you miss that?.
warren isnt going to endorse bernie why are people still talking about this.
Better be tulsi or Nina afraid it’s will be warren.
Wow, what the hell is happening? Sanders supporters slamming  @ewarren who's arguably the better choice when it comes to progressive policy pragmatism?https://twittercom/elmorautio/status/1237142234203652096 ….
Even if I bought the whole "give warren time" narrative (I dont, its ridiculous)  what does she need time to decide on? Endorsing a progressive candidate aligned with her values or  Biden  Like?? Wheres the hard decision??.
Aren’t you the politician who pretended to be a progressive and then actively helped the establishment dems when we needdd you the most? Yep, that’s the warren I remember.
@ewarren Why Aren't you endorsing Bernie Sanders? If you believe in Universal Healthcare, you know Bernie is our best chance If you bail on us, while the others are lining up to support Biden, what was your purpose for running? #NotMeUs #UniversalHealthCare.
So you’re saying a warren endorsement wouldn’t swing it.
Today I voted for @ewarren in the SC primary Of course I’d like for her to be the next president, but I doubt it’ll happen Hopefully it’ll be Bernie.
No dark money A PAC Not a super pac Which warren has had too Lies suck Please stop But not surprising liars support a liar Please look into differences.

I was all for warren early on, even over Bernie But then I saw a change in her and her attacks and that's didn't sit well with me I honestly wanted her and Bernie on the same ticket Bernie as POTUS and her as VP Only reason in that order is so she could run again in 2024!.
If it weren't for the bernie bro myth and the shade shes thrown his way I think warren supporters are 50/50 real progressives.

bernie then warren then biden for me personally.
this just piles my disappointment at the american people right on top of the fact that hillary was tossed out with 3 million more votes than that wretched shitbag the thought of a warren presidency excited me in a way i haven't felt since obama's 2008 campaign.
I am furious about the primary results as it regards @ewarren I am not being a fan boy, but do you think if it was a man who was highly educated, a senator, a public advocate & had started a federal agency, he would have been ignored like this too?.
by that logic, lets combine every single person who voted for pete, amy, bloomberg, and joe that outnumbers bernie + warren in several states.

#IdesOfWarren @ewarren should stay through the March 15 debate! Warren don't go! We need your voice!.
my dad said the same thing - and he's a warren devotee.
Dear @ewarren - Bernie is not a Democrat, you would be allying yourself with someone who has never declared themselves a Democrat Stay in the party, effect change from within when you work with the Democrats to remove McConnell Please, don't start a war No one will win.
@ewarren I love you & your audacious plans I share your vision I’ve donated to your campaign & was planning to vote for you You offered a calm, clear eyed & bold path forward Biden can win and his humanity can help heal the country Bernie cannot & will further divide us.

The snake emojis didn’t help, and it probably came up when Bernie talked to warren.

anyway - the other bit is that I don’t think there’s actually a coherent “progressive movement”, as evidenced by the massive gulf between warren and bernie stans.
am i crazy or are all these types of tweets incredibly demeaning toward elizabeth warren https://twittercom/rmayemsinger/status/1236025733845094400 ….
can’t believe elizabeth warren went on snl when our country is in a crisis.
I would vote for warren just bc of this video  https://twittercom/nbcsnl/status/1236523965759262720 ….
yeah its seems so dumb to me plus, AOC has probably been asked by the bernie campaign to mend the bridge to warren and her supporters dumping on her is so stupid, so shortsighted.
i agree that bernie supporters make some bad faith arguments and take unfair potshots at warren but i rlly can't for the life of me take u seriously if u don't vote for the Next Best Thing bc some ppl were meanies to u online i just c.
Elizabeth Warren has a plan: https://elizabethwarrencom/plans/protecting-from-coronavirus ….
But Hillary had a majority of the delegates? I just don’t see it happening If warren was in first I would be all in, but she’s not, and we can’t let the progressive movement die off.
@ewarren drop the fuck out What are you doing? I used to love you I have lost all respect for you I got over you turning your back on @BernieSanders and your endorsing @HillaryClinton in 2016 You know Biden can’t beat Trump  Endorse Bernie My kids are counting on you.
I’m voting for warren because she’s got ideas similar to bernies but realistic ways to pay for them.
@CNN @MSNBC @Morning_Joe  This is why Biden is very risky, Vote @ewarren or @BernieSanders.
Watching @MikeBloomberghe is the best Democratic candidate! He is moderate, knows business & was mayor  @ewarren & @BernieSanders are too far left @JoeBiden is a trainwreck and can't put simple sentences togetherthere is no way Biden is going to be competent for 4yrs! pictwittercom/VjYNqGibmR.
Elizabeth Warren, Please Drop Out for the Sake of a Better World - In These Times: http://inthesetimescom/article/22337/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-super-tuesday-biden-drop-out ….
So does warren just get to keep the $26M for her own personal use?.
do biden and warren next please https://twittercom/dccised/status/1202254660305862657 ….
warren has a plan for LITERALLY everything and she can build a unifying coalition to beat trump plus, it’s time for a woman in the white house.
There’s not a clearer explanation of how you should vote during a primary  #warren.
this is how he communicates at a rally you can't parse policy like a wonk and expect normal people to follow your point this is also one of the reasons that warren is under-performing in the primary.
Thanks Barry  Fingers crossed It was lovely to see one out of the warren! The cherry blossom is out just next to the warren and I'm hoping to see some of the kits out soon, eating fallen blossom as they did last year It was so cute .
@ewarren says she’s staying in to be a spoiler   Is this what you want, team Warren? https://twittercom/angela_rye/status/1234628690090303488 ….
This is a fantasy  Vote for warren but you’re not progressing anything.
Your primary coverage tonight completely omitted a candidate - @ewarren is still in the race She has more delegates (of the 4% decided) than Bloomberg, polling second in CA Why? #warrenerasure #ChooseWarren.
Don’t vote Biden Don’t vote Bloomberg Vote Bernie Or hell, even warren.
A vote for warren is a vote for Trump at this point, I hope you can live with yourself.
it really is for a very good reason tho not consolidating the progressive vote as the moderates have done means cutting the progressive vote in half both can't take the nomination, and warren has <1% chance, making her the spoiler.
I liked warren early on but she’s trailing so much it’s baffling that people are still pushing hard for her.
I switched from @ewarren to @JoeBiden when I voted on Saturday I love Warren but it's just not going to happen right now.
@ewarren is getting my vote  I may have to suck it up and #VoteBlueNoMatterWho in the end but not in the primary!.
Maybe warren isn’t actually a progressive.
We really need to realize and understand just what the DNC is going again Biden is NOT the people’s choice, the DNC is NOT the party of the people @ewarren please endorse @BernieSanders, we need this unity now more than ever If you’d been winning like Bernie, I’d swap voteshttps://twittercom/BenjaminPDixon/status/1234562142986231809 ….
How about this? You tell @BernieSanders to drop out and endorse @ewarren She gets it done without all the baggage There is nothing Sanders has done that Warren hasn’t done or will do better You white women really cut each other’s throats for your white men .

bernie i think warren & bernie are very similar but imo bernie's a stronger candidate because he's more clearly anti-imperialism.
me with elizabeth warren https://twittercom/koriindahousee/status/1234569604493664260 ….
americanos desistindo de votar na elizabeth warren pra votar no bernie pro biden não vencer é a mesma de não ter votado na marina pra votar no ciro de última hora ksksksks a história é cíclica e misógina.
wish warren and bernie would just get along and band together to go after the real threats, biden and then turnip.

not the warren volunteers sending large swaths of texts trying to convince me to vote for her lmaooo  -- drop out pictwittercom/nWohTc97Qn.
so the democratic party is really gonna do bernie and warren like this and ignore our concernswelp, if biden wins the bid.
isn’t voting for warren the same as voting for biden.
wow how is it even possible to hate warren? What in the world has fox news done to make people dislike her? I do do spiritual counseling :).
people are mad at warren for not dropping out to make way for bernie but not biden for being a significantly worse candidate who just so happens to be polling better than her? why?.
Biden First choice warren.
Interesting that warren being a “capitalist to her bones” doesn’t turn more “activists” off Lol.
Dream on it's not going to happenbiden will pick abramsbernie will pick warren.
Iraq was bad And the reason it was bad is that it showed poor judgment  Biden had the chance to deny GWB a blank check, and did not take it  But that does not mean that the only alternative is Bernie  I submit that @ewarren is the right candidate if you are mad about Iraq.
god PLEASE kill the notion that you have to vote for a woman just because you’re a woman elizabeth warren’s past is so fucking iffy, y’all support anyone without research.
This is so much of why I'm supporting Warren She knows what's been damaged, who needs to be removed, who is qualified  People don't realize how much their government does behind the scenes: just hardworking people making America safer  From things like pandemics https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1233526491281010689 ….
@kinsellawarren warren did you call the guy about the big wiener for sale in Calgary? .

In @ewarren Twitter thread cited, she talks about gen'l elections NOT primary elections, you know PARTY primaries/caucuses where PARTY gets to choose PARTY's candidate for president AND gets to choose PARTY rules for the process She doesn't like SDs but abides by PARTY rules.
I just voted (via absentee ballot) for @ewarren in the CA primary and it felt GREAT  10/10, highly recommended~   #TeamWarren #VoteWarrenpictwittercom/nTUipkyDwd.

How come lizzy warren wears the EXACT SAME CHEAP STUD EAR RINGS every time we see her  The ear lobes look fake!!!.
One of the biggest reasons I'm behind Warren is that she's got a *long* list of accomplishments already  Lofty ideals count for nothing if they can't be translated to actual change @ewarren has the ideals, the plans, *and* the proven ability to performhttps://twittercom/ewarren/status/1233173100600188930 ….
i was open to warren until recently, but im upset she shifted her focus to trying to get the nomination at a contested convention without getting the most delegates regardless of whether its justifiable, someone getting the nom that way will tank the dems' chances against trump.

am i misunderstanding the term? i thought it was the misconception that native identity was expressible as a dna percentage, rather than an actual cultural attachment to other tribal members have seen native critiques of warren for perpetuating the blood quantum myth.

You've made a compelling case for elizabeth warren not being the democratic nominee and an absolutely moronic one for primarying her senate seat.
