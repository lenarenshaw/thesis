Why the hell do you think I’m talking about sanders?.
And by the way, when you say that a certain level of dem will lose their position if sanders wins you are proving my point, which is that sanders will not support the mainstream Dems in the house and senate We need them.
care to comment, @briebriejoy? as a sanders supporter this  is disappointing.
