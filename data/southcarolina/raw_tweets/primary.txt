Exactly Many South Carolina Republicans are openly planning to vote for Bernard "Bernie" Sanders in the state's open Democratic primary, and the SC GOP is disavowing this but probably only because it clearly reveals they want to see Trump beat Sanders in the general election: pictwittercom/qEgwE58hsM.

I’m going South Carolina, 2 people GOTV a week before primary!.
They will be out with a smear ad before the S Carolina primary I hate politics Pete’s right I would rather watch cartoons and I don’t even like them I won’t Just saying Pete and Chasten must exhausted.
Starting the primary with tiny, mostly white states is part of systematic racism   What a different primary we'd have if South Carolina voted first Biden would likely be on top But, who knows? If South Carolina was first, maybe Kamala Harris would have stayed in the race.

Yep, Graham needs to go But guess what? The South Carolina primary is coming up soon and JAIME HARRISON has a good chance to beat him I just donated (again) because I'm frankly terrified How about you? https://jaimeharrisoncom/ .
What I'm hoping for here is that if Joe Biden gets rained on in New Hampshire then that doesn't snowball into Nevada and (especially) South Carolina  States like Iowa and New Hampshire are a lot whiter than the *average* democratic primary voter.
For now, Biden is holding onto his African American support in the February 29 South Carolina primary and leading in most national polls But those numbers may look different next week if he limps home in fourth or even fifth in New Hampshire http://bitly/38cwdvQ .

Also  Why is the GOP primary party hopping to vote for BS in South Carolina Because they know they can beat him but no other DFL candidate  Go study the facts.
Kristol was literally blowing a gasket because the Trump campaign was telling their base voters in Nevada and South Carolina to vote in their state's open caucus/primary for Bernie Sanders His fraudulence and hypocrisy is no better than Trump's and I suspect he knows this.

Joe Biden is facing formidable competition in the Democratic primary in South Carolina, a state he has long considered to be safely in his column It's the first Southern state on the election calendar and an important gauge of black support http://apnews/h8BfpeL .
About the same as Iowa The states do not represent the Democrat party demographic at all South Carolina is much closer That, to me, will be a much more interesting primary result.

In South Carolina you can switch sides, but  you can not vote R in one and D in another, so it’s not as dangerous when both parties have primaries BUT since R’s don’t have a primary this time, it’s lethal And shouldn’t be BUT R’s have a state majority, so it’s crooked.

I wish someone would report on the Republican efforts in South Carolina to vote for Bernie Sanders  The state allows any party to participate in the primary, the GOP wants Bernie to win to scare voters and they are making no effort to hide their campaign to do so.
Also, South Carolina is not even having a republican primary, so republicans have nothing to lose by voting in the democratic primary.

The only poll that matters is primary day Biden has very strong black support in South Carolina Let’s see the next few weeks when campaign ramps up down there.
Also Justice Democrats PAC as well Everyone knows that Trump would most like to face Bernie It is also well known in South Carolina that there is a push to have Republicans vote for Bernie in the primary How many Rs are contributing to those 2 PACs? pictwittercom/ydr7yYtjlo.
The GOP will terrorize red and swing state voters with this stuff—and more—and it will work Won’t even be difficult That’s why they keep helping him There’s an out in the open effort for Trump voters to help Bern in the South Carolina primary  Why?.
I’m thinking the same while watching him on Meet the Press This is the problem with Iowa and New Hampshire leading the Democratic primary process The test for all the Democratic candidates is South Carolina IMHO.
In SC Bernie is 14 points behind Joe Biden, and Pete is 25 points behind Biden If Bernie or Pete wants to be the nominee, they’ll have to do far better with black voters than these South Carolina numbers suggest   https://wwwpalmerreportcom/analysis/new-hampshire-primary-what-going-on/25065 … via @PalmerReport.

Which is why he'll lose in South Carolina My only concern with that state is the massive push for republicans to vote for BS in the SC Democratic primary since they won't be having a republican primary of their own.
Forget South Carolina  It is an open primary so everyone can vote which will skew the results  Republicans are openly telling people to go vote for Sanders because they think Trump can win against him.
Biden has been murdered for the third time in his life by Iowa He's going to walk out of New Hampshire without his shoes And I'm fond of Uncle Joe But unless South Carolina, an open primary state, gives him first second and third place he's toast and you know it.

It's wild how the order in which the states went changed the narrative around Biden lol if South Carolina went first, this was probably going to be a 2 candidate race already To be honest, probably just having a primary state going first instead of a caucus one would have been.

In another primary with a different field, Biden might fade out But there isn’t another non-Bernie consensus candidate All Biden has to do is stay alive until South Carolina And for all the media pronouncements of his death, he’s exactly 7 delegates behind Pete (1991 wins).
Have faith in Deval There is a path Biden and Warren will underperform in #NHprimary Patrick will exceed expectations in NH and will be the best middle choice going into South Carolina After that it's Patrick, Sanders and Bloomberg and Patrick wins that.
As for Mr Biden, his campaign and career are on the line: If he is humiliated on Tuesday for the second time in two weeks, his political advantages in Nevada and South Carolina, which holds its primary on Feb 29, could crumble.

In the immediate term In the medium term: Steyer is Biden’s primary threat in South Carolina, Bloomberg is an up-and-coming potential spoiler, Pete’s black support levels are still atrocious, & we won’t really know how bad Biden’s in for until after SC.
Its South Carolina or bust for Biden needs a big win if he does then Super Tuesday looks decent for him to pick up Alabama, NC, Virginia, Tennessee Texas the entire Dem primary will come down to March 17 when Florida & Ohio vote & April 28 showdown in PA & NY.

Even in Habana we know that in 1992, one Democratic candidate (in a 6 person field) lost SIX straight primary contests It was until South Carolina and Georgia voted that he was propelled forward  That was Bill Clinton.
and he's entering the South Carolina primary!.
Agreed I think right after the South Carolina primary.

@chucktodd: Why are you in South Carolina and not New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary?   @TomSteyer: "I take New Hampshire very seriouslyI spent last week in New Hampshire, and I'm trying to make sure I stay ahead of the game in the other early primary states".
Is it weird that I don’t really want to make my primary picks until AFTER New Hampshire? If I wait until the actual day (We vote on Super Tuesday) I’ll have South Carolina and Nevada data to look at, too, whereas if I vote the very first day of Early Voting (the 18th) I won’t.

Sanders has generated enthusiasm from younger Black voters in South Carolina That could help him avoid a repeat of his dismal showing in the 2016 primary, when African Americans overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton  http://bitly/31Lez02 .
also, hot take: south carolina gets an unreasonable amount of hype in the primary calendar, considering that it's only three days ahead of super tuesday.
He isn't going anywhere until after the South Carolina primary Iowa (91% white) and NH (93% white) are not indicative of a general election.

If The first primary were held in South Carolina, Joe Biden would be the front runner This process is so unfair.

Exactly  Imagine what Bernie (or Warren) would be saying if we started off with Maryland and South Carolina primaries and everyone decided who was "viable" based on those results  This isn't difficult  Best to start with a 4 state primary that is a representative of the US.
It'll be interesting to see, especially in states like South Carolina where anyone (not just undeclared) can vote in either primary There are reports Republicans are urging GOP members to vote for Bernie.
@MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews  It doesn’t matter how VP Biden polls in the NH primary, where undeclared Independents and registered Republicans can vote for any Democratic candidate Biden and Mayor Buttigieg may suspend their campaigns *after* Nevada and South Carolina.
 POD DELAY FYI this week’s @SCledepod episode will drop Wednesday so we can bring you New Hampshire primary results and analyze what they mean for South Carolina #SC2020.

South Carolina Democrats should do whatever they can to defeat the GOP effort to boost Bernie in the open primary If Bernie wins he'll be crowing about it going into Super Tuesday knowing damned well he got Trump's help (see WV 2016) He'll never acknowledge it.
But of course he did Open primaries are set ups for mischief South Carolina is an open primary, so expect Bernie to get a huge bump from GOPers who want him to win https://twittercom/AuthorKimberley/status/1231683408000098304 ….

I will make up my mind on who to vote for in the March 3rd California primary on March 1st, after seeing who won the most votes from black voters in the February 29 South Carolina primary I’m taking all my cues from black voters White people - don’t bother.
Could the Iowa meltdown happen during North Carolina's primary? - https://googl/alerts/4sqa7  #GoogleAlerts.
#berniebro on his way to sweeping the first three @DNC primary contests   Still neck and neck w/ #buttplug on delegates though   South Carolina will be HUGE factor towards nomination.
The GOP has closed the following primary SO NO ONE CAN RUN AGAINST TRUMP  Alaska Republican primary Arizona Republican primary Hawaii Republican caucuses Kansas Republican caucuses Nevada Republican caucuses South Carolina Republican primary Virginia Republican primary.

At 36%, Joe Biden has a double digit lead over his presidential primary opponents in South Carolina, with Tom Steyer leapfrogging top-tier candidates at 15%, for the second place spot in the early voting state, according to a new poll Politico.

In South Carolina you don’t register as a specific party EVER on your voters registration It is always open and you can always choose which primary to vote in; but you cannot vote in both primaries in the same year They don’t even know who the Republicans or Democrats are.

Joe Biden will not visit Minnesota before the March 3 primary The campaign has announced travel to five other Super Tuesday states: North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, Texas and California.
It is really hard to see my community here in NC basically be discounted by all campaigns for the primary election So many voices here not being heard because they’ve already been counted out Eastern North Carolina deserves better!!!!.
Biden campaign rolls out its pre-Super Tuesday schedule (he's spending tomorrow and Friday in South Carolina) Feb 29: Raleigh, NC, before returning to Columbia, SC, for SC primary night March 1: Selma, Ala, and Norfolk, Va March 2: Houston and Dallas March 3: California.
This was a particularly bad debate overall Would be interesting to see if it affects South Carolina primary If anything, may improve Biden's chances a bit but likely didn't hurt Sanders' https://twittercom/krystalball/status/1232491915792138241 ….

And I certainly hope the good people of Nevada, South Carolina, etc, remember that all polls indicate that Biden is is best suited to beat Herr Troompenfuhrer If Bernie wins the primary, we’ll hear the word “Communist” over & over &  lose the Senate & possibly the House.

It is my understanding that Trump’s cult is organized to vote in Democratic primaries In Souh Carolina anyone can vote in a primary without declaring party affiliation I’m sure some other states are the same way.
Hes actually doing very well in national polls You dont seem him in early primary polls bc he isnt running in early primary states Hes hoping to outspend everyone on super tuesday and win I believe hes third in south carolina and second place in national polling.

Necessary but a problem for anyone looking to break out No cohesion before at least South Carolina, now   This primary is turning into such a mess.
Absolutely true, the primary is about who can win Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Arizona    What issues drive those states, should be driving the Dems https://twittercom/TheValuesVoter/status/1229591404864835585 ….
I will cast my vote for @BernieSanders in North Carolina's primary today, as I did in Vermont in 2016 I will continue to support him and encourage others to do so I do not like the way Bloomberg is funding his campaign without having shown mass support, let alone past stances.

In South Carolina, @TomSteyer is drawing big crowds and credible poll numbers Pundits who dismiss him as an also-ran need to recognize that massive advertising and a big investment in grassroots mobilization has made Steyer a contender in the second primary state pictwittercom/plyfKG2mSt.
Warren has no path to the nomination at this point Unless you live in Nevada or *maybe* South Carolina, you likely won’t even get the chance to vote for her in the primary If she loses in her own state of MA during Super Tuesday it would be a total embarrassment politically.
Unless you live in Nevada or South Carolina, you kind of really don’t If Biden is eliminated (which is a huge risk before end of February), that’s exactly what this primary will be   Bernie or Mike.
South Carolina (54 delegates) won't matter much  Its primary is Saturday, February 29  Super Tuesday is *three days later* with 14 states (1433 delegates)  Sunday is not a news day  Monday is, well, Monday  I doubt SC results will shift people's feelings about candidates.

He's on the rise in South Carolina though, and I don't think anyone's arguing with you about your primary vote as long as you vote for Bernie in November lol.
Georgia is another closed primary state, where you can only vote within your declared party However, in the November general election, it's a full ballot vote South Carolina is an open party primary and there are grassroot efforts for a Chaos Vote, wherein groups of Repubs 1/2.

So, heads up Texas voters: Nevada’s primary is Feb 22, and South Carolina is Feb 29 Candidates may drop out after one or both of these, so you may want to hold off and vote on Election Day (or at least after Nevada), instead of voting early, which ends Feb 28.

South Carolina has an open primary Republicans are encouraging their voters to vote for Bernie Sanders in that primary   That’s why I have a problem with open primaries Members of the Party should be the ones selecting the DEMOCRATIC nominee No one else.

South Carolina does not allow write-ins in a primary, and does not have an “uncommitted” or “no preference” ballot choice.

Thankfully, Nevada and South Carolina are next on the primary schedule, so we can actually start moving into halfway-functioning states now.
And, given reports that Republicans may flood the Democratic ballot in the open primary in South Carolina to vote for Sanders, for obvious reasons, we should prepare to ignore that one also.
I don't care about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina  Super Tuesday will decide the primary  #SuperTuesday #Warren2020.

Same on South Carolina where Republicans can vote in the primary There is a big push for the Republican Bernie vote because they believe Trump will squash him in the general.

Liz Warren polls horribly against Trump, and her losing would almost gurantee she gets a primary challenge to her senate seat in MA, where she's not popular either She needs to be rekt in Nevada and South Carolina.

You see February 29th in South Carolina is the primary South Carolina has an open vote state so we know who Trump easily beat in a general election and that's Sanders I'm a republican I will be voting for Sanders 29th The  US Has less than 5%support for  socialism.
Tom Steyer still running 3rd in the polls for the South Carolina primary #SC2020 #scpol.

Honestly in large part due to starting the primary in two tiny 95% white states, which have small/radical Dem caucuses over bigger/diverse states If this started in Illinois and South Carolina, IMHO, Biden is the front runner and would be winning Nevada Instead here we are.

Harry Reid is obviously shoring up Nevada, but that story that dropped today about Reid preventing Bernie from running a primary campaign against Obama was all about the "I was Obama's bestest buddy" bullshit ad that Bernie just dropped in South Carolina.
I remember when the Democrats wouldn't let Stephen Colbert run for the South Carolina primary.
That is a great idea except the Republican National Committee decided that there would not be GOP primaries in several states including South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas There were two men who attempted to primary Trump and this effectively shut them down.
No the opposite actually if Biden wins South Carolina and then stays in until after Super Tuesday then the Democratic primary is essentially over The more candidates that stay in getting 10-12% of the votes, the better it is for Sanders.

If the 5 Democratic regulars still in the race don’t coalesce around someone two days after South Carolina, this primary will get chaotic (It’s not bad yet).

Ever wonder why Republicans are voting for Bernie in open primary states like South Carolina? It's because they WANT him to run against Trump because they know Trump beats him by making the Election at vote AGAINST making America a socialist country  Please get that  Please.

Since South Carolina is an open primary, the GOP is telling their voters to vote for Bernie Sanders Because of this, South Carolina will not give an accurate picture of where the candidates stand.

I think there will be and there should be great pressure for the Democratic regulars - in other words, all the remaining candidates other than Bernie and Bloomberg - to coalesce around a single candidate after the South Carolina primary.
I don't think taking the South Carolina primary polls and running with it is a very safe approach to determining who the best candidate to win the white house is.

I get that not everyone wants to support Bernie in this primary, but I simply CANNOT UNDERSTAND why anyone who voted for him in 2016 would not do so in 2020unless it comes down to sexism (which, in South Carolina, it almost certainly does).

Biden will rebound in South Carolina & beyond  Surprising how many people want to call the election after one primary  Media had to quit projecting winners before the polls closed on election day & I wish they'd stop deciding the election in February too.
Practically speaking, the best primary order would be: Nevada, New Hampshire, Illinois, South Carolina then Super Tuesday  Illinois would be a much better early Midwest primary state than Iowa  Nevada should be first because it's small & representative.

North Carolina doesn't have "open primaries" Ours are "semi-closed" *Only* unaffiliated voters can choose the party primary they wish to vote in Party members can vote *only* in their registered parties' elections.
Bernie is having a breakout night This is very similar to Obama in South Carolina's 2008 primary - doubling up on competitors, taking a big chunk of delegates, shocking the world.
DEAR South Carolina, While we all want President Trump to remain president, we need to vote for Bernie Sanders next week in the primary.
At this rate, next Saturday at the South Carolina primary, MSNBC will just feature James carville screaming at the top of his lungs  NEWSFLASH: THE PEOPLE NO LONGER CARE WHAT YOU THINK!  #NevadaCaucus #NVCaucus.
So it’s lookin like Bernie is about to win with +30% of the vote in Neveda With a field of about 7 candidates that is a strong win Bernie has won the most votes in the first three states of the primary and leads in delegates Next is South Carolina.
Basically the same reason Biden & Bloomberg are All-In on South Carolina No way either one wins the state as Democratic nominee, nobody will, but to get the nomination it's a state where they have to do well to get further in the primary.

A Republican PAC is paying for ads for a Democratic Senate candidate in North Carolina, aimed at forcing more primary spending http://bitly/2ujNVit  @stephanieakin.
Super Tuesday is on my birthday  If you're from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, or Virginia in lieu of subs, bits and tips go vote in your states primary for Bernie Sanders  thx.
South Carolina us a open primary.
"Bernie Sanders can win the South Carolina primary"  Chuck Todd just said that!!.
Joe Biden has retained his lead over Democratic primary rivals in South Carolina, a new poll shows, but support for the former vice president is plummeting as Senator Bernie Sanders is closing in http://owly/eDpu30qjJ4k  @ErikaKate5.
In South Carolina they were/are using the open primary to swing for Bernie with a website!  Please journalists put this timeline together!.
[The PAC, which was just created last month, has run ads that appear to attempt to boost fortunes of state Sen Erica Smith at the expense of former state Sen Cal Cunningham]   Alright N Carolina, don't let @senatemajldr interfere in your primary  http://mstartribunecom/mcconnell-linked-group-funds-ads-helping-n-carolina-democrat/568079982/ ….
Remember  that Republicans in South Carolina have an organized effort to vote for Bernie in the open primary on February 29, because they believe (correctly!) that he will be the weakest candidate against Trump  There is even a tv interview where a Republican states this! https://twittercom/Santucci/status/1230966727183405056 ….
If it was published a month ago it would have been to sabotage Iowa or New Hampshire, next week South Carolina, a week after that Super Tuesday There's not a time right now that isn't right before an important primary election.
GUEST ANNOUNCE - Our guest this week is former Governor of South Carolina and US Representative @MarkSanford, who was most recently an early challenger to President Trump in the 2020 Republican primary Make sure to check out his episode this Sunday! #FlyDaypictwittercom/ElIKVP2qaw.

We’ve had 1 caucus and 1 primary Tomorrow is another caucus and then Tuesday is South Carolina and then Super Tuesday March 3 rd  Bernie and Pete have the same delegates Vote for whoever you want Calm down and stop the mud slinging #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica.

Really? Well you are about to see it South Carolina made sure Trump was the only “Republican” running for President Trump, in turn, has urged Republicans to vote in the open primary for Sanders, who he thinks he can beat Maybe you like Sanders, maybe not, but this is bad.

Yup, and also, Klobuchar is on life support with AA at 1-2 So is Buttigieg So is Warren, now in two states, South Carolina & Georgia  AA would move to Bloomberg if Biden left and then a clusterf*ck primary would occur-- Trump is the only beneficiary of this scenario in a GE.
Absolutely In fairness, I was using a broad brush There are interesting trends in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas making those states a bit less Red  Guess my point was the states which will decide general election (MI, WI, OH etc) have less influence on the primary.

Thank you I’m listening to and following black voters’ lead Planning to watch polls and South Carolina primary before deciding on my Super Tuesday vote.
Disney's local TV station tells us unaffiliated voters can choose to vote in the Republican, Democratic or Libertarian primary Unless I'm mistaken, they forgot to mention that the Green Party also has a primary ballot available in North Carolina for the first time this year.
South Carolina has no Republican Primary so Republican voters should disrupt the Dem primary.
Why don’t we just let the people of South Carolina determine that for themselves come the primary.
I’m so depressed by the Dem 2020 primary field I hope someone emerges in the field in South Carolina, specifically someone who can build a diverse coalition.

Lol right! First time I get to participate in a primary this early Getting a ballot before Nevada and South Carolina vote is throwing me threw a loop  I don’t like the pressure of the early-ness though .
Yes, what about Nevada? Open primary? And South Carolina? We won’t know until more closed primary states vote.
President Trump also said in his Oval Office event that he will "probably have a major rally" in South Carolina before the primary election there.
What’s up with Unethical South Carolina GOP attempting to get GOP primary voters out to vote for Bernie to make certain HE wins SC Sabotage the DEM vote for a non liberal socialist to win   Or did u miss that Post & Courier headline?.
In Biden’s defence, he was up against 2 neighboring Senators in each of the first 2 primary/caucus elections He will win South Carolina BIGLY!.
MN would have to be the least interesting state to cover? Klob is going to win by a lot in the primary North Carolina and Alabama and Colorado would be the best to cover.
March 3 (Super Tuesday) Alabama primary American Samoa  Arkansas primary California primary Colorado primary Maine primary Massachusetts primary Minnesota primary North Carolina primary Oklahoma primary Tennessee primary Texas primary Utah primary Vermont primary Virginia primary.
Super victory for Bernie Important dates coming up are February 22 and February 29 The South Carolina primary is an open primary, which bodes well for Bernie independents! As for Joe, Elizabeth and Amy - Bye, Johnson! Mayor Pete and Bloomberg will be the competition for Bernie.

Given how oversaturated the primary was, that was to be expected South Carolina and Nevada are the states where he will likely see more of a return on investment given how he was really the only one to run ads there for most of the year He doesn't really have a path after that.

Yes There was a coordinated GOP effort to get Republicans to vote for Bernie in the NH primary The same coordinated effort is being deployed for the South Carolina primary, where Republicans are being encouraged to vote for Bernie.
It remains to be seen how things shake out in South Carolina but people are reading too much into the 2016 primary  Bernie had high popularity with black voters in 2016, they just liked Hillary more.

Not my job And I am not on team Sanders Let’s continue this discussion after the South Carolina primary.
Nevada is a caucus so unless you're registered Democrat you can't don't know what South Carolina does if closed primary then no there either.
Joe Biden was polling at 44% in South Carolina in December if I'm not mistaken  If he does not win the primary there, he will drop out 100%.
Let's hope the Trumplicans don't sow too much chaos by voting for the candidate they feel can't beat Trump South Carolina is an open primary state.
Hopefully the Republicans don't sow significant chaos bny voting for whom they feel Trump can beat South Carolina is a open primary state.

So, why did Republicans prohibit ANY challengers to Trump on primary ballots in NINE states  Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin  What is @GOP afraid of?.
We’ve had one caucas and one primary at this point and Buttigieg has 22 delegates vs Sanders 21 Iowa and NH were two of the smaller states for delegates South Carolina has 54 and Super Tuesday on March 3rd awards 1/3 of total.
