Isn’t that true by definition since we’ve never known the popular vote in caucus states before now? In any case, wow indeed!.
I guess technically in previous elections we didn't know the Iowa caucus popular vote.
The caucus is trash been trash it’s time to turn the clock forward.
In Iowa, it's a fucking coin toss The caucus system is Dumb? Old? Something Something doesn't sit right with me about it What happened to just voting and counting who got the most?.
How hard is it to pick a person  Count the votes  Fuck caucus’.
Bernie won the Nevada caucus thug ass mf i love him.
Pretty sure Sanders winning one caucus and his hometown primary doesn’t mean he has won the nomination   Slow your roll, mothafuckahs.
Bernie is leading about 54% in the Nevada caucus! #BernieIsTheFrontRunner I’m so happy!!! We got this! #NevadaCaucuses.
Just left as caucus captain for Warren at precinct 7603 Sanders 48 (5), Buttigieg 41 (4), Warren 30 (3) Your the best Steve!.
If there’s a tie in baseball after nine innings, the solution is more baseball, but if there’s a tie in a caucus, the solution is a coin toss  I mean, what could be a better signifier of how our “democracy” works than “fuck it, we’re gonna just let money decide”?.

I’d like to know how Chris Matthews doesn’t get fired or at LEAST suspended for comparing a Jewish man’s win in a caucus to the Nazis invading France.
To clarify- in normal elections all political buttons/stickers/tshirts must not be visible in the poll  That rule doesn’t apply in Nevada today bc they don’t do typical voting as their primary They do caucuses which are WAY different & actually encourage participants to campaign.
And it's happening again even as we speak  Looks like another DDoS on the Nevada caucus' call centers by people jamming their phones https://twittercom/mattblaze/status/1231126799586865157 ….
There are over 600,000 voters registered as democrats in Nevada  So, the total number voting in the caucus is less than 10% - 75,000 voting early  That is an extremely low turnout.

Thought I was getting in trouble for coming back from the caucus late but talked my way out of it.
One three-time precinct chair, who led a caucus in Henderson this year, just wrapped up their caucus and told me it "went much better than expected," before adding, "yay, we're not Iowa".
All of the Sanders volunteers diligently did the caucus math on their own worksheets and submitted final pictures of the official math We literally have the receipts #NVCaucus.
and none of your "screenshot or clip of Pete claiming he's the legitimate heir candidate because he can't win elections" make it reasonable for the media to ignore the campaign that has won, through single donations against pete's corporate backing, every caucus/ primary so far.

Is Nevada going to mess with the caucus like they did last election?.
And he’ll do it again if we nominate him for president  PS That’s why he caucuses with the Dems It’s in exchange for them not backing a Dem challenger for his seat Quid pro quo.
Or caucus.
Way to hard to model with the addition of early voting  Any guess Jon on what percentage of voters will choose the early vote option? Looks like a lot less hassle than actually attending a caucus.

Didn't something like 70% of the voters do early voting, which is like a primary? That's pretty all they need to know The voters have spoken Ditch the stupid caucuses.

I called that one a few days ago Between that and the plane loads of MAGA hats being flown in to caucus IOWA, the CORRUPT REPUBLICAN PARTY just has to be up to DIRTY TRICKS with the sudden rise of Bernie’s popularity! Bet MAGA’s are going to support Bernie’s numbers so far.

I went by my early voting site today (Nevada caucus), and the line was outside the building!  I will go back during the work week.
Of course, the fact that this is already a caucus to begin with is an enormous advantage to Bernie Sanders So far the rules have been heavily tilted in his favor.
I would call it voter manipulation, manipulating early voters to pick a 2nd and 3rd candidate (which does not happen to the people who go caucus in person).

On the actual caucus night, if someone shows up and registers their first preference but then leaves, their vote won’t matter Because they didn’t actually participate This makes the rule the same for early voters.
The Democrats’ first four contests include two caucuses, an open primary, and a semi-open primary (And the first two contests are in nearly all-white states) Hard to imagine a worse way to start the nominating process.
In @ewarren Twitter thread cited, she talks about gen'l elections NOT primary elections, you know PARTY primaries/caucuses where PARTY gets to choose PARTY's candidate for president AND gets to choose PARTY rules for the process She doesn't like SDs but abides by PARTY rules.
65% of caucus goers where white?.
Bernie Sanders lost the Iowa caucus twice in five years.
Somehow both of you got my pronouns wrong lol, but superdelegates were coming out in favour of specific candidates after each state’s individual primary/caucus Things like this influence election outcomes pictwittercom/4iQzz9vDrr.
The thing is it’s not really a true democratic vote when there are caucuses and open primaries where Republicans are voting for Sanders in order to sabotage the Democratic Party.
Sure he is he votes with the Democrats, he caucuses withe the democrats he goes along with the democrats coups  He's a dem.
Clinton won Iowa by the closest margin in the history of the state's Democratic caucus O'Malley suspended[b] his campaign after a distant third-place finish, leaving Clinton and Sanders as the only two candidates.
