AOC is making the Democratic party look stupid! They have been praying for someone to take her seat democrat or not.
Have you heard of the civil rights movement Neera (neera to a republican than a democrat)? that’s the plan.
Using 60% voting in favor on the Dem side and 30% on the Rep side, you would need over 67% of senate as democrats to be able to pass it with a simple majority (67 dems at 60% = 40, 33 reps at 30% = 10)  Republican support also tends to "rally" around the majority, so #MATH ??.

I'm kind of sad about a great punching bag leaving the racebut the democrat party still has plenty more where he came from! Epic political failure = democrat party.
As long as Bloomberg rams as a democrat he will be eventually sanitized .
Yang has the strongest cross over appeal from what I’ve seen but hes not radical enough for the democrat base I feel Bloomberg could honestly sweep this “Bloomberg is racist” BS under the rug The attacks on Biden failed.

Please do no support one racist over another Bloomberg is a career repulican who switched to democrat for the optics He's a racist He won't win against Trump.
@NBCPolitics This CORRUPT president spent the entire state of the union address mocking,branding, & Blasting the democrats for "Socialism" (& everybody KNOWS he was talking bout SANDERS; So now that the 1 he's Really Afraid of (BLOOMBERG) is rocketing up the polls, we're s'posed.
I don't care about these labels I said the democratic base African Americans, women, youth are all big parts of the D's base Bloomberg, Biden and Sanders have a big problem significant problem with at least one of those segment of voters If that's the case D's lose.
Because the Plutes are absolutely terrified of her  Because she will kick their fucking asses, dust off FDRs regs, etc  They love them some sanders though because they know he has no shot of winning this election and he will erase democratic gains up and down ballot.

Now that we’ve see the repercussions of that, can we assume ALL democrats will vote against Trump, no matter the nominee If not, we deserve Trump  So if that’s the case, shouldn’t we be focused on middle-of-the-road voters who voted for Trump, but would swing to a moderate dem?.

There are over 600,000 voters registered as democrats in Nevada  So, the total number voting in the caucus is less than 10% - 75,000 voting early  That is an extremely low turnout.
Even those who don’t support democratic socialism can admit there are many nuances to the outlook that Americans often neglect and that these are likely to come under discussion in an interesting way if Sanders is the nominee.
How can you run on the Democratic ticket and spew crap like this? You need Democrat’s to actually vote for you    Signed, The democratic establishment.

If this was true, it would have come out long before now Just more democrat BS.
Bernie as much as I like some of what he says has never cosponsored any meaningful legislation that ever passed and is only a democrat when it serves his interests He also should have dutifully supported Clinton after she got the nom rather than act petulant.
He’s not a socialist He’s a social democrat and would be a centrist candidate anywhere in Europe His policies are milquetoast concessions to the exploited, and a slight reprieve from US war and aggression to SOME in the global south.
All communists called themselves "democratic Socialists" and promised to save mankind by taking control of economic and political resources No different, just in case of Chavez, Maduro and Bernie Sanders they try to achieve that power gain through democratic process not revolt.

I am a democrat, but I am not a progressive I think that @realDonaldTrump is destroying this country, and I can certainly explain why if you'd like to discuss But, I certainly think that patriotism is great Xenophobia, otoh, is a cancer on our society.

In other words you’d vote for someone who was a Republican up to two years ago, became an independent and only recently a nominal democrat, who has been fighting against wage rise, enthusiastically supported stop and frisk and red lining,over someone who wants to help workers?.

But here's the honest truth of it MOST of what Trump's policy has been isn't that different than what a moderate democrat would have run on only 10 years ago So I really think that's where your moderate blue and independents will cast their vote.

Any “democrat” who supports Bloomberg is as racist as trump and his supporters.

Sanders is at heart a “from each according to his abilityto each according to his need” progressive socialist boardering on communist He is hiding behind the oxymoron “democratic -socialist” and still cannot name a  successful socialist/communist country.

nah i just wont vote unfortunately Hopefully the democrat electorate doesnt nom a gop billionaire as their nominee  .
Tough choice for a mindless democrat voter .
Markets knew Obama was going to be the next president long before the 2008 election Obama and the democrats are solely responsible for the 2008 crash Democrat Senate Banking Commitee heads, Chris Dodd and Barney Franks created the housing bubble.
And now other democrats are attacking Bloomberg.
I don't like it when conservatives call democrats racist when they tell the truth about black ppl Conservatives calling Bloomberg racist for the truth should turn in their conservative card.

No one is above the law unless your a democrat .
You obvsly want to mold this story rather than report it!  Sandernistas protested Iowa caucus results - where was this snide attitude from you then?? You are promulgating a false narrative, colluding in a harmful anti-democratic charade to smear a good man Shame on you.
the bernie reality is insane for a lot of democrats because they are mostly broken in dogs who will vote for any democrat if it comes down to it but realizing that the one they have to vote for is him will cause them to crisis for 2 months but still vote for him in the general.
Trump has revealed he is in the plot to rig the democratic primary for Bernie Sanders he's been instructed to take an easy on Sanders for the moment The plan is to install Sanders as nominee then when timing is right use Russia as leverage over Sanders to destroy him.

Trump pays more attention to Biden than the other democratic candidates It’s not because of corruption There is none Trump wants to ruin Biden’s campaign and help Bernie get the nomination Trump and the GOP are salivating at the prospect of a run and win against Bernie.

@esaagar is rightThere are millions of working class democrats who are social conservatives but vote dems because of Unions especially in places like Wisconsin and my state Pennsylvania, we even have dem pro life groupBut Bernie Sanders policies are rebuke to traditional values.
Or if it depends on an undemocratic process, maybe don't run as a Democrat?.
Well I think the main  argument of the democratic socialists of America is that they don’t want to try to understand or appreciate capitalism.

If Warren has a higher "percentage of supporters who will vote for the Democrat" than Bernie, that more likely means she has much less appeal to non-democratic voters It is a huge reach to think dominance has anything to do with it.

Or they would set him up for impeachment to make themselves look good for being “impartial enough” to impeach a democrat Then Hillary could take over.
All I'm saying is if that's what's happening they might be able to do it  I'm not making any judgement on if that's going on or not or if it's even happening that Republicans are voting in the democratic primary  I'm just pointing out that logistically it's possible.

"This is the biggest problem our country have faced Our plan to fix it is to put our bumper sticker on it and claim it as ours"  At least now we know what the democratic establishment issue with Trump is The fact he didn't run as a democrat.
