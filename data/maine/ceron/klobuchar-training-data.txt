Bernie should offer klobuchar an ambassador position to throw a rat trap at Pete.
They can pick multiple choices Pete, klobuchar supporters pick joe.
Pick a woman folks Warren or klobuchar Wish we could’ve had a Harris choice but we have what we have It’s the year of the woman Women pushed the wins in 2018 And frankly, I’m sick of white men screwing things up And I can promise u, I am not alone in those thoughts.
I have a MS in sport management, and it’s working out pretty well for me Telling people they shouldn’t follow their passion is a pretty interesting (not in a good way) take from a moderate Dem like @amyklobuchar.
not a klobuchar fan, but it’s supremely disappointing that someone who writes for a living would say she’s LYING when she doesn’t think a thing you want could pass it is literally a prediction, not a statement of fact words mean things https://twittercom/meaganmday/status/1226623500573536256 ….

@danbalz: "Klobuchar now appears to be an unexpected and unpredictable force in the closing hours of the primary campaign here" https://wwwwashingtonpostcom/politics/klobuchar-gets-a-moment--and-hopes-she-can-make-it-last/2020/02/10/9a3ad982-4c3c-11ea-b721-9f4cdc90bc1c_storyhtml ….
How much black support does @amyklobuchar have??? Less than @PeteButtigieg at 2% and that is a low bar At least Buttigieg has @ReggieLove33 (Obama’s right hand man) Maybe Amy has someone to help her with blacks but winning only in Minnesota (way whiter than Indiana) is an issue.

This was my first American political rally  I am near the front of the crowd in this photo  Amy Klobuchar is the candidate for me    Experienced, grounded, sensible, and fiscally responsible  I would be proud to call her my President https://twittercom/amyklobuchar/status/1226658626930122752 ….
the majority of the country does not support a full government takeover of healthcare klobuchar is the far more electable alternative.
Lets go for a warren klobuchar ticket then, shall we?.
