I think bidens weak point with people otherwise likely to vote for him is trade, jobs and social security, followed by m4a, and specifically framing him as a stooge for big business (because he is)  nobody likes their credit card companies, biden is the credit card company man.

Trump wants to take away your healthcare @Joebiden will protect it And we all know how important are your meds!.
Intellectually challenged @joebiden is vulnerable and defenseless against Tulsi's well targeted to the point attacks DNC is fully aware he wouldn't survive the debate Let's hope Bernie can inflict some deep wounds on absolutely pointless biden.
Bernie isn’t a Democrat so he doesn’t care if the democratic party is hurt And a number  of his supporters have already said they have no intention of voting for biden if he is the nominee so I guess they prefer trump.
I feel like the corporate media is setting up joe biden to be the goat in jurassic park  They dont care if he loses, they might even prefer it!    #tytlive.
the gag is biden is only a year younger .
i’ve done a little bit of googling and joe biden seems like a good candidate is there anything bad i should know about him or is he alright??.
tbh that's one of the biggest rays of hope for bernies primary chances biden voters dont give a fuck about biden, they just want a "safe" choice as evidenced by his inability to pull votes from pete, klob, etc without them dropping any big hit to the momentum & "safety" is huge.
need non stop factual ads on biden's record with polling data showing bernie beats Trump at a better margin in florida airing nonstop.
horrifying and hilarious to watch how little biden’s brain works.
Now you are trying to act like “it’s just you trolling “ When you’ve cried about how I should leave biden alone  And you like him Lol That was the first day  I’m just proving you soo wrong Now you are trying to pretend it’s something else lmao.
i feel like a lot of people would turn against her tho if that was the case they would see it as her selling out, especially bernie supporters if he loses the nom policy wise it doesn't really make much sense for her to join with biden when she's been running as "progressive".
A lot of ppl believe biden is the best.
Sanders supporters want him to make a damning case against Biden — but it will backfire badly https://wwwalternetorg/2020/03/sanders-supporters-want-him-to-make-a-damning-case-against-biden-but-it-will-backfire-badly/ ….

if warren joins up and the progressives go on to beat biden and head to the main event that will be some serious long term booking.

The problem is that the dropouts will allow biden and bloomberg to reach viability and get more statewide delegates, which means less of a wide win for Bernie and easier justification for yoinking it from him if he can't break 51% overall =/ also less blatant momentum in turn.

If you really think that then you have no idea why trump was elected in the first place He is very strongly situated to win an even bigger victory this time, especially if biden or Bloomberg were the nominee With joes obvious dementia he wouldn’t stand a chance.
If bernie can take texas and then either VA or NC Id call that a very good night for him If he gets texas but loses the others Id say its pretty even If biden gets all 3 hes more or less the nominee.
if ur voting for biden I’m just gonna assume ur an idiot.

Joe Biden said I am an obiden Obama Democrat idk what that is but if Biden is one then I want to be one too.
