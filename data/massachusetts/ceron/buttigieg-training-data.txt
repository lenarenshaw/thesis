Who is Pete buttigieg.
Bernie declaring victory without 100% of Iowa results reported, didn’t we just crucify buttigieg because of this? Just trying to be fair #tytlive.
i once passed pete buttigieg on the street (he was having a rally at the emerson colonial) & didn’t recognize him until i heard someone say “mayor pete?” & don’t regret a thing, but i think about how inspiring it must have been for him to have an encounter with a future president.
