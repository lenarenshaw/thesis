Lol, which is it? Is he or is he not a dem? And should he be allowed to run in a democratic primary?.
when i went to numazu for the summer festival and i saw chocobananas out in real life, in their primary element, i got so excited and had a "oh my god they're real" moment.
Joe has too much baggage I vote for the person who gets the most votes in the primary I won’t vote for anybody that cheats their way in.
Yeah, but unfortunately the current primary system is based off of momentum, and Tulsi won less than 1% of the vote in Iowa and only 3% in NH She’s not gonna be in any future debates, limiting her outreach, and overall voters don’t like her There’s no viable path for her.
Debate about to begin between state Rep Dan Brady and his GOP primary opponent David Paul Blumenshine pictwittercom/TQdPj1pUVv.
You missed the walk back: https://wwwcnncom/2017/11/05/politics/donna-brazile-primary-rigged/indexhtml …  Short summery: Brazile lied, and Warren jumped on the 'rigged' bandwagon without even thinking about it or trying to understand anything  They were both wrong, provably, and both walked back their comments  Wake up to reality.
This current breakdown of projected delegates somewhat reminds me of what the results were in the 2017 Democratic primary for Philadelphia District Attorney Krasner, like Sanders, was the most progressive candidate in the race https://twittercom/NateSilver538/status/1229916120469118978 …pictwittercom/hChtlKgKdJ.
Do some more research, Biden's plan is actually more expensive than Medicare4all I'm 38, been on Medicare for 10 yrs & don't want anything to do with private health insurance as primary coverage cuz I can go to any dr   I choose & Medicare won't abandon me when I need it most.
This is so deeply concerning It’s getting almost zero media attention, and the skewed primary results could force a Democratic candidate to withdraw from the race This is straight up *election rigging* Un-American to the core.

Yep I have seen a bunch of California voters saying today they’re switching their vote from Warren to Biden in the California primary just to try to beat Sanders such a bummer-she’s a much better candidate! (Than both of them).
The longer this primary is, the more I want a day time talkshow for Andrew Yang.
Hence the name democratic primary.
All I want for my birthday is a great result for @PeteButtigieg in the NH primary!.
Thank you!  She's my first choice too  Our primary isn't until May.
You are such a spiteful woman! What makes you think so little of Americans that you are throwing up the Russia smokescreen AGAIN? You're running a real live COMMUNIST in your presidential primary, who might WIN, and Russia wants TRUMP? Insulting our intelligence STILL!.

I'd just like to point out that @PUBG has been out for three years and this has been a primary issue with the game since day one https://wwwyoutubecom/watch?v=AV_UpDzgeZ0&feature=youtube ….
