But we DO know how/what he’d go at warren and bernie and Biden forthey have loads of history to attack.
Trump will destroy her Bernie too Vote yang To my mind, trump is terrified of someone like him He talks about bernie and warren a lotcuz he knows how/what his attacks will be Yang would utterly THROW him off.
There is lots of fertile attack ground for trump against warren What does trump against yang? Help me out.
I was one Wanted the progressive candidatethought warren or bernie was that Nah They’re just more old white folks that will be beholden to the same shit Watch Yang videos of him one on one-NOT the debates He’s much much better.
Who dose trump fear more Biden or warren because I just love seeing these ads where they both are saying the same thing.
