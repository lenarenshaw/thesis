Bernie wins both the first and second rounds of voting but “loses” the primary Great system we have here https://twittercom/SteveKornacki/status/1226652590907281409 ….
@realDonaldTrump please tell me the last time any incumbent President had to tour during a primary election?  All have waited till the general election!  You are just haphazardly muddling all the waters of our Democracy!.
I can imagine that meeting  Fuck guys we got to cheat better Explain why Sanders isn't screaming about paper ballots? Also be aware If this was anywhere not a caucus you would've been cheated without anyone beyond the culprits ever knowing This is how you lose the primary btw https://twittercom/bagniewski/status/1225181775170809856 ….
Yep, wasn’t my primary story today, so it was an initial inquiry.
As of now, @AndrewYang is the only candidate going to @Dartmouth / Hanover between now and the primary  That’sa lot of votes left up there in a close and wide-open primary https://twittercom/Dartmouth4Pete/status/1225113346711736321 ….
