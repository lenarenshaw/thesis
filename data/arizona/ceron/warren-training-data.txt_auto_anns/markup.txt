<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">@ewarren, please explain to me how rehashing stories about Bloomberg's NDA's helps Democrats beat Trump or defeat the Russian influence in our elections?</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Stop the infighting & start focusing on the issues Most of us are exceedingly worried about Trump's actions in re:DOJ, DNI.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">elizabeth warren’s “righteous indignation” crumbles now that she has flipped on both allowing super delegates to undermine the democratic process of “who gets the most votes wins” + taking super PAC money when she based her campaign on anti-corruption.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I really don't care for her doing that at all There are more important issues like beating Trump This infighting is a turn off to me I just cant vote for her in the primary Warren Goes After Bloomberg Again, Offers Contract To Release Women From NDAs https://wwwhuffpostcom/entry/bloomberg-warren-nondisclosure-agreement-releases_n_5e4f6c17c5b6b82aa650b010 ….</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Not to worry, warren's campaign is dead, only reason she is in it is by the narrative of leftist MSM.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">yeah sorry warren has absolutely lost it https://twittercom/Yamiche/status/1230354408707371008 ….</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Bernie and warren,   Bloomburg and klobuchar, Biden and a nice hospice nurse.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">In regards to debate last night you should have said warren recently lost staff due to hostile work environment I bet your  workplace lawsuits are statistically insignificant if you compare to total Bloomberg employee population  Bring this up in next debate.</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It’s not over More angry Warren please  https://wwwcosmopolitancom/politics/a31022050/elizabeth-warren-debate-anger/ ….</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Barista who was for Yang who last week said she was considering @MikeBloomberg after seeing tons of ads for him on SnapChat just told me she saw him in the debate and he totally lost her (both by being so obviously unprepared and from @ewarren beating the shit out of him :).</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">She may have lost my support in the primary but still it’s hard not to like @ewarrenhttps://twittercom/mj_lee/status/1231005553737920515 ….</MPQASENT>
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">I watch you all the time @Lawrence   I am a lifelong Democrat  But I was turned off watching @ewarren cross-examine Mayor Bloomberg  Does she believe she was persuasive?</MPQASENT>  <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">How does the existence of a couple of NDAs amount to anything given what is going on in this country?.</MPQASENT>
