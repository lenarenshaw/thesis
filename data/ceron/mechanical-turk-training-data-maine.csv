"Look, I don't know how anyone is suprised at this point.  All of these people are in the same boat.   Democrats are the party of lucifer.  The rational ones like Tulsi Gabbard are chased away.  But all of them are evil.  The devil can no longer hide his horns.",maine
Investing in a good mattress is a must,maine
"You know what? Candidates like Yang, @SenSanders @TulsiGabbard should be the future of our party. They get it. We all know they get it. Instead, we get to hear #RePeteButticheat pontificate endlessly bc #PetesBillionaires say so & everyone think Iowa likes him.",maine
I'm just curious... what is it about HIM that makes people put HIM before the best interest of America? I truly don't understand. I wouldn't defend a Dem President if he did wrong or if he threatened our American way of life. I don't understand u all. Our Country should be FIRST,maine
Democrats might well believe in unicorns  I'm not going to worry about one attacking me  Bloomberg is a repulsive little weasel who thinks he can run your life better than you can  Trump would love to run against him.,maine
Absolutely.  Vote blue no matter who or if you are repub or dem.  We need a total cleansing of the WH and Senate. 3 years has been way tooooooo much! Is there anyone out there that feels good about how trump has treated them that has worked with him?,maine
It sounds like the DNC is choosing Mayor Pete since Biden has crashed and burned so bad they can no longer get away with fake polls or carrying his water without being laughed out of the room.,maine
Revenge list begins:  1. Get Hunter Biden travel revords 2. Fire LTC Vindman and his brother 3. Fire Borden Sondland 4. Senator Mitt Romney 5.  #TrumpsVengenceBegins #Vindman,maine
He like his DemocRAT partners got to pretend tgey where doing some moral good when they all knew a case for conviction was not made and no real crimes were charged. So Romney gets to ride what he call as moral high horse while accomplishing nothing but self gratification,maine
"So does everyone get that Elizabeth Warren did really, really well in Iowa? Or no? Okay. Go about your fight boys, ladies onward.",maine
Bloomberg will eat Trump & spit him out.,maine
"Did Bernie win Iowa? Is he likely to win New Hampshire?   Is these DNC slow to finalize Iowa results so Bernie doesn't have too much momentum going into SC, Biden's ""firewall""?  Why does Biden need a firewall?",maine
Pete with no path after  NH? No one thought he'd do as well as he did in IA. The consenus was Bernie or Biden would win.,maine
Nobody knows how Buttigieg could win because the only way possible is by him cheating  There is no other explanation because that is the explanation,maine
"By GOP logic there is nothing wrong with what Biden did. So why are they investigating him more then the president? Never mind, stupid question.",maine
"Yes, Mike Bloomberg is a short liberal .  Hardy, har, har.",maine
