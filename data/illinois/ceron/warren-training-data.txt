Trump makes string of racist comments about Native Americans during attack on Elizabeth Warren https://wwwindependentcouk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-maga-rally-elizabeth-warren-native-americans-las-vegas-a9352006html ….
he’s a very high risk candidate and trump still has a strong voter base  i think warren is the middle ground between sanders and bloomberg but america is still not ready for a woman president .

the dnc doesnt actually support warren they only want to use her to take votes away from bernie thats the hard truth https://twittercom/detachment_red/status/1230591341169696775 ….
Love your passion but at some point you have to come to the realization that warren has the best chance of coalescing support from the left and the center left It will be much more difficult to win the general with the Bernie as the candidate than Warren.
“warren’s problem is that SHE” there fixed it.
I don't know what you think I was referring to, but my point was unlike ppl like Sanders+Klob, her history runs behind what's to be expected from a Dem in her situation Eg ending 7pts behind Obama in '12 https://fivethirtyeightcom/features/4-things-elizabeth-warrens-last-election-can-tell-us-about-2020/ ….

Extremely harsh and disgustingly classist — hopefully warren reigns in her toxic supporters.
I agree with this I didn't really like how the DNC changed the rules for Bloomberg, but I also think letting him in the debate is one of the best ways to hold him accountable I want to see how all the other candidates respond to him https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1229850791562956801 ….
It’s initially designed to be a Luddite anti bernie take but is effectively anti warren.

She sounds bitter and jealous Especially cause people jumped ship to Bernie I liked warren and then I was like naw Bernie where its at.
A year ago today, I started working for @ewarren in Iowa  She was polling at 4% & the media was counting her out  Less than a year later we came in 3rd in the Iowa Caucus  How?  We became the media Our grassroots network told @ewarren’s story in living rooms & on porch steps.
Isn’t Bloomberg already the party’s collective waking nightmare?   But, yes I’ll heed this advice and ween myself off of politics before bed if any more nominees start popping up in my sleep    Except for @ewarren I’m *totally* okay to #DreamBig with Elizabeth Warren .
It's President's Day, so I'll make it official: my vote in the IL primary goes, enthusiastically, to @ewarren   I want a president who listens and learns and cares and plans, and that's Elizabeth Warren  (I represent just me, not my organizations) pictwittercom/OISb2dxbmY.
I think those words are unreasonable given that nobody is “dismissing her “existence”  she’s losing If there was any indication she could Not Lose, pundits would be all over it — theyre desperate for any alternative to sanders They loved warren when they thought she had a shot.
Pretty funny that Dem pundits are convinced a guy who’s served in the Senate for decades is going to destroy the country (I support @ewarren but come on).

It’s a great day to knock on strangers doors to help elect Elizabeth Warren for president  elizabethwarren illinoisforwarren @ Chicago, Illinois https://wwwinstagramcom/p/B84gSbfhmHt/?igshid=14vv9f9qq1b6j ….
Yes I am voting for @ewarren in the primary, but will vote for Bernie if he is the nominee.
me and the boys doing our targeted harassment campaign of elizabeth warren pictwittercom/UK46sWW5ba.
@ewarren “The arts help us define our value as individuals” Her plan to cancel student debt would be a boon for many indebted arts majors, as would her health insurance plan More than any other candidate, Warren’s plans would change how much we invest in arts programs for youth https://twittercom/artscrusader/status/1231208152663838720 ….
@smerconish I disagree that warren won the debate Debates should be more about issues and policy to determine that winner All warren did was attack everyone so she didn’t have to answer, which she didn’t, to her electability Quite frankly she needs to be a Democrat and get out.
Besides, that Bear was just canvassing for @ewarren and showed up at a Bloomberg house.
If @ewarren really thought she stood a chance of winning, why isn’t she going after “front runner” Bernie? I mean, at all? Why continue to focus on Bloomberg who dropped off massively after the debate? I’m so over this primary.
my friend warren got rightfully dragged for taking the bully bait with that stupid dna test  i know the NYC monopoly guy has had 2 stents off the top of my head  (BTW a *letter* from my teacher saying that i am super-duper smart is not the same as a *transcript* but whatever).
*whispers* maybe not everything that happens to warren is misogyny, cuz some things are, but let’s not forget she pretended to be a poc for a significant portion of her life and the way ppl overlook that is trash and she /should/ be ignored.
the only person eating shit harder than liz warren right now is kaitlin bennett’s boyfriend.
Case and point I'll be voting for Warren https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1229972375174893568 ….
The gaslighting of Elizabeth Warren by the press should be the #1 thing we’re talking about @ewarren.
warren also won’t do well in the midwest.
why are u warren supporters so toxic.
warren.
warren bros are so toxic pictwittercom/IKxL8ze6Xd.

I could wait til the southern primaries and Super Tuesday But all of us #warren2020 folks should recognize that, demo for demo, Sanders has real support in the form of actual voters  (Also, that Dick van Dyke endorsement ad speaks even to me) https://twittercom/pajiba/status/1231581746614784000 ….
man everyone is really dunking on @JRubinBlogger’s angry liz warren tweet honestly guys i usually like her but her takes have been whack as HELL recently.

senator warren leaving the debate after dragging everyone else through their shit pictwittercom/Ytpg8ixqzZ.
how did i end up following this many people who are voting for elizabeth warren ahhh help.
no— from jennifer abt warren criticizing her (and only her) for being angry.
I love seeing all of these memes of @ewarren destroying Bloomberg lol go Liz!.
did you see the angry warren tweet?? where the HELL did that come from?!.
Same! After I met @ewarren at a rally I made my *first ever* donation to a political campaign Last night after the #DemDebate I donated to Warren for the third time   After watching her rip into Bloomberg, I can’t wait to see what she does to Trump!  #WarrenForTheWin.
So no @ewarren supporters have a problem with her saying the voters may not be smart enough to choose the winner and we need to trust the #DNC? I know she wants to win but she would risk letting Biden or Pete take the nomination they didn’t earn over @BernieSanders? #Warren2020.
At the start of the debate - “So, who's coming in second?” Elizabeth “Larry Bird” Warren https://twittercom/ewarren/status/1229850791562956801 ….
@ewarren  I’m a  Tulsi Gabbard / Bernie Sanders supporter  You were fabulous tonight  Stay the course on Palestinian rights- My kids maternal family hails from the West Bank-  and you have a fan- and if you get the nomination- a new supporter.
I hate asking, but I genuinely seek my friends' support - who will help me donate to Warren? I honestly wish I could, but I'm not allowed to due to camp finance rules If you step up and donate just a couple of $ in my name, I would be so, so grateful https://elizabethwarrencom/ .
@MikeBloomberg could use one of these given that warren swept the leg on his ass https://twittercom/mollydeez/status/1229970863895842821 ….
I can see and feel the rage @ewarren must feel by having to even stand next to fucking Bloomberg on that stage — I hope she doubles down post-debate until he cracks.
Having sympathetic feelings for Bloomberg after @ewarren eviscerated him so rightfully is a rite of passage in white male patriarchy!.
Which who divided and mostly depressed      A few like warren  Some Bernie  Some Bloomberg/Biden  But# all ( black and white and Latino young and old  Wish someone more Inspiring.
$35 to warren.
I’m actually not holding anyone to a different standard because I’m not the one attacking other progressives for having progressive grassroots support organized into 501c4s, as if they’re big money interest groups— and neither did sanders — warren did.
Sanders isn’t hitting anyone on having grassroots pac support like warren was him Can you screenshot the part of that article that shows Warren’s response to the new pac? I seriously missed it.
??? I actually did look through the article and only caught a quote by klobuchar, and the reporter specifically included that she did not say they should stop — didn’t see a comparable part for warren, and may have missed the quote, which is why I asked? (And now it’s paywalled).
no one:   elizabeth warren to mike bloomberg: pictwittercom/hsad0g4POM.
@ewarren is my favorite candidate but I just don’t feel like she will win this primary #torn.
lol #Friskberg getting roasted so hard he gonna fuck around and drop a c-bomb on warren watch .
warren hates bloomberg so much lmfao shes not even hiding it i love it.
oh my god warren is ripping bloomberg to shreds rn this is bad.
OMGGGGG !! ELIZABETH WARREN IS MAKING ME SCREAM FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS  SHE IS GOING ALL IN YASSSS #DemDebate @ewarren.
I just did a single clap so loud it (a) woke my cat and (b) made my ears ring - well said, warren! https://twittercom/elizaorlins/status/1230313927025840133 ….
oh my god liz warren shot a man in reno.
the way pete listens to men on the stage vs snarling at warren and klobuchar when they speak the misogyny pictwittercom/8gPdQqW5Mu.
I  Elizabeth Warren! She is so ready for this debate tonight and to be our next president!  #presidentwarren #teamwarren #persist.
I love that @ewarren does not have even a fraction of a minute for having to deal with Bloomberg.
what is warren even taking notes on.
elizabeth warren just ROASTED mike bloomberg h o l y s h i t that caught me off guard.
