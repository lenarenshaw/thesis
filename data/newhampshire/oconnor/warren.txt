My Prediction for the 2020 Democrat Presidential Nomination:  @BernieSanders wins Iowa and New Hampshire  After two straight victories for Sanders, the field narrows considerably as many others (including @ewarren, @PeteButtigieg, @amyklobuchar & @TomSteyer) drop out (1/8).
In California, Sanders Phonebanking for @ewarren mainly Iowa and New Hampshire.

@ewarren is heading into the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary trying to gain support from a group that’s key to cinching the Democratic presidential nomination this year: Latino voters  https://wwwneprnet/post/lagging-among-latino-voters-warren-ramps-outreach ….
1) @ewarren campaign is offering free child care at a lot of caucus locations this year! 2) @iowademocrats tried to make more changes so the caucus would be more accessible, and New Hampshire lost its shit because it was "too like a primary" (Spoilers, it wasn't).
Today is caucus day in Iowa Our @ewarren office in Madison has been open for 3 weeks Team Warren  has been working so hard and I couldn’t be prouder As we go full tilt through Iowa and New Hampshire, @WisconsinWarren is putting everything we got into big change for all of us.

I mean, at best he'll get declared a narrow winner after New Hampshire, when he may well have won a straight primary vote and at worst would have finished a strong second to someone with basically no chance of beating him 1-on-1 https://twittercom/warren__terra/status/1225540353031364615 ….
If I was still a warren supporter I would have been saying he should drop out   I believe she will after New Hampshire I don't think there is any way to get her out before then Just too close.

Looks like @BernieSanders attacks on @ewarren worked in Iowa Now if he wins in New Hampshire a state that he won by 20 points in 2016, MSM will declare Warren’s candidacy dead!.
What do the Iowa caucus results so far tell us? @ewarren's vision for big structural change, and her plans for focusing on corruption, climate change, and creating economy that works for everyone, are highly popular On to New Hampshire! #LFG.

We’re one week away from the New Hampshire primary, which means we only have a few days left to call voters in the Granite State and make a difference before Tuesday! Let’s get to dialing: http://ewarren/call-voters .
pete and biden are both polling better than her in new hampshire, and I don't see her doing better out of iowa than pete but we'll see! i'd've preferred it being bernie/warren/the rest of them too, but it isn't looking that way atm.
I just don't see how anybody else can consolidate both warren and buttigieg were relying on a good result in iowa, because bernie is winning new hampshire and nevada is between bernie and biden.
Biden is a dead end candidate   New hampshire is as meaningless as Iowa turned out to be  Until Bernie gets hit as hard as warren was last fall, the campaigns go on as they were.

Um votes still being counted still tied for the most delegates whopped warren and Biden two things that where important Him and mayor cheat will end up very close to the same delegates also where wining New Hampshire in a landslide.
It's crazy how nobody is talking about warren today The day before Iowa every 10 word on the news was about her Today it's like she never existed Biden is still getting plenty of press and he was behind her After new Hampshire Elizabeth's campaign will collapse.

elizabeth warren is closer in campaign promises to bernie than she is to buttigieg this is something warren supporters should consider as she makes a gamble to focus her efforts in new hampshire where bernie has an incredibly strong lead.

one of the best illustrations of the reality that political pundits know nothing is that many of them think warren will do well in new hampshire bc she’s a massachusetts senator.
That's right #New_Hampshire #DemVoters #BarnieSanders ideals isn't realistic#Trump will have a field day on his Policy ideals #Buttigieg got 2much Personal baggage @ewarren she can't get healthcare Policy stable,the Country already n a $27trillion debt #VPBiden is the way.

I just filed my absentee ballot for next week's New Hampshire Primary for @elizabethwarren #NHprimary #ElizabethWarren #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020.
I wholeheartedly want @ewarren to be the nominee However, it looks like in the #IowaCaucus @PeteButtigieg will most likely be the top victor (though Warren didn't do too shabby) I do want to congratulate Pete & say "see you in New Hampshire!".
The New Hampshire primary is better adapted to @SenSanders The candidate with the most votes wins @ewarren should also hang in there because anything can happen, but I would advise her to make a progressive argument for winning voters from moderate candidates #USpolitics.
6 Days til NEW HAMPSHIRE    -@JoeBiden in Somersworth + evening CNN townhall in Manchester -@BernieSanders in Derry  -@PeteButtigieg in Concord then  to Summit, NJ + New York for fundraisers -@ewarren in Nashua: @AshleyJudd for Warren in Goffstown, Concord & Hampton.
The debacle in Iowacaucus is just a strategy by the establishment dnc to give lifeline to warren and biden until New Hampshire They are trying to slow Bernie Sanders's momentum by showing him trailing when in reality he won it in Iowa.

i liked the way #buttigieg declared himself winner in iowa reminded me of al haig declaring "i'm in charge" when reagan was shot   he's shot his midwestern wad he's unlikely to get much in new hampshire, backyard to both #sanders and #warren he'll fade out after NH, i predict.
