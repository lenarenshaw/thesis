You are so ignorant to the truth We’ve had a very close PresidentL election - remember 2000?  Also, this caucus was not tampered with Stop lying It was a software glitch which the company acknowledged .
I learned at a young age that dirty laundry gets cleaned at home, by airing out all the dirty laundry of the caucus, Dem candidates might just be putting a nail in the coffin early Find a good basement with a bar and figure this out without causing more harm.
I watched the caucus in detail in real time as a relatively new resident here and for its quaint historical interest Lovely people the Iowans, but it is clear why people were losing patience Democracy will benefit if they move to a simple ranked order secret ballot https://twittercom/PhilipRucker/status/1224672743901278209 ….

Iowa Democratic Party Chair apologizing for caucus debacle About to release data from 62% precincts LIVE @wbz.
i think the joke is that caroline designed the caucus app lmao.
YesThey know he is positioned to overtake them all after the first 4 states primary/caucuses,which he did not enter because he started lateThey are treating him like a fellow candidateThey know he's starting to suck the oxygen out of the room, the he's for realTHEY'RE SCARED!.
Two years ago we walked into a Dorcheste ward caucus committee and two years later @AyannaPressley is out here slaying the #Occupant and delivering for #MA07https://photosappgoogl/YYQHAJsAqVpH4kq3A ….
So @SenSanders got more votes but Buttigieg got more “SDE’s”? Who knew Iowa had an Electoral College?!  https://wwwnytimescom/interactive/2020/02/04/us/elections/results-iowa-caucushtml ….
With respect Tom, this doesn’t seem possible A small group could figure this out for the remaining 500 caucus sites in a couple of hours How hard is it to compile three numbers from each site? Seems like the DNC is trying to bury the real outcome to protect Biden and boost Pete.

Must read from @mtaibbi — this really puts the state of the Democratic Party in perspective as we head into tomorrow’s #FITN primary https://wwwrollingstonecom/politics/politics-features/iowa-caucus-democrats-disaster-trump-sanders-949655/ ….
The Red Sox handling of the Mookie-Price trade might be a bigger disaster than the Iowa caucus Discuss.
Definitely And I was still sad when I heard that caucus-goer try to change their vote when they found out he was gay Passing privilege is huge I’m empathetic because there are so many parts of me I still hide and yet still am not doing great surviving capitalism.
Not talking about Sanders His foreign policy needs to be better My mind could change But have fun defending the guy that cheated the Iowa caucus.
Iowa caucus: be nice for second choices count New Hampshire primary: folks have only one vote Debate strategy changes from bouquets to baseball bats @juliemason @POTUSPressPool.
