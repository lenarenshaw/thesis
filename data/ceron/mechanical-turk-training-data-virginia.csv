PRICELESS! Commie Warren loses again. That woman could never tell the truth and never will.,virginia
"He is saying stop pandering and getting distracted by stupid stuff that alienates large portions of your voters. He seems to think that Warren has what it takes but is getting bad advice, hopes that she will come to her senses and tack right. Has less faith in others.",virginia

Welcome aboard! The Dems have to be big on dividing people-its all they have . Dem party platform is  socialist goals( really communist)  and dividing people is part of a 50 year communist plan to get your freedom and power. It's amazing if one looks up CPUSA goals from the 60s,virginia

Amy K seems to be hurting Biden more than Buttigieg.,virginia

"@fellformel I too was told were we part native american. My mom told me to put it on my law school application. I didnt because I had not suffered the injustices as they did. I didnt deserve special treatment. You and Warren didnt either, but you tried to game the system.",virginia
