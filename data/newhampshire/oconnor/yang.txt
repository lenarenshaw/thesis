Prediction for Iowa and New Hampshire: Bernie wins Iowa, Yang is top 4 Bernie wins NH, Yang is top 3 After that some people will start to drop and Yang won't drop below top 4 again! #yang2020 #yanggang #YangUnitesAmerica.
i will always love yang but if he underperforms in iowa i will be considering putting my weight behind bernie new hampshire is even worse for him than iowa and if he can't even get iowa my faith will be pretty shot, but i'm hoping for the best for yang tomorrow.
yang should have just gone all-in on new hampshire.
Come on I like yang, but you're delusional if you think he has a shot at this point Hell get no delegates in iowa and he'll lose New Hampshire and then drop out.
Although I don’t support yang, he could perform a lot better than expected in early states due to the nature of the caucuses, New Hampshire.
Funny thing is, while centrists are freaking out about #BooHillary  Voters in Iowa & New Hampshire are googling  “Joe Biden social security”   Bernie’s gonna win!! https://twittercom/ryangrim/status/1223702235508551681 ….

I’ve been VERY hard on yang lately  but he’s still my #3 behind Tulsi and Bernie’s #1 but I really do hope yang does well in Iowa I just don’t see the polls that show it He’s polling much better in New Hampshire I think that’s yang’s chance to do very well tbh.
I think we should start trending iowa and new hampshire specific #’s like #iowachoseyang or #iowaforyang or #iowacaucusforyang post personal stories or why iowa and new hampshire should send a measage to the country and chose yang Just an idea.

@AndrewYang will win Iowa, Yang will win New Hampshire, Yang will get the nomination, and yang will beat Trump, Because he’s perfect for the economy and he’s the only one that will unite us from this divide after the 2016 election #YangWillWin #YangSurge #YANGYANG.

Why would yang gang help someone else at caucus? The narrative is that whoever wins Iowa/New Hampshire wins the primary Why help someone do it? Isn't a fragmented field better because it leaves the path open for Yang, instead of closing it by handing these wins to someone else?.
yang wont last past new hampshire --.

The latest Iowa poll had Bernie at 30% and Yang at 5% New Hampshire is basically the same story I’m sorry but his campaign is pretty much dead in the water It’ll end up ruining it for all of us if Biden is the nominee Bernie needs support from yang and tulsi would be voters.

Oh Iowa and New Hampshire But that doesnt confirm anything as i am just one voter Also i said im fine with it, i dont support him If yang isnt viable by my state i wont be voting.
Maybe you’ll switch your support when yang comes out strong in Iowa and New Hampshire Bernie is on record saying he has no idea what his plans cost he will lose the general in my opinion Yang is not bought off like Obama was he will expand healthcare.

The #yanggang has been so depressing these past few days had to go offline( felt really good too though)  Guys criticism of Yang is warranted I definitely did not think he had a great debate That said, the man has by far the most events in Mew Hampshire He's working hard.

It appears to be in jest However, make no mistake He's not kidding, and the US is being led to a dictatorship with the help of the GOP Senators and cyberattacks from Russia The Iowa Caucus debacle was not an accident, and I predict the same for New Hampshire #yanggang https://twittercom/realDonaldTrump/status/1225174713992990721 ….

Andrew Yang Returns to New Hampshire on February 4-11, 2020 **Updated https://blog4presidentorg/2020/2020/01/andrew-yang-returns-to-new-hampshire-on-february-4-11-2020html ….
which cannot be implemented if you're not viable  so my original question was --  will yang bow out if he does poorly in new hampshire  collecting donations in this economy for a vanity campaign hurts the presidential race and down-ballot opportunities, imo.
We got one percent of the 1 percent No worries Nevada is the big price If we can win Nevada we will give them a run for their bread on super Tuesday We obviously won't win new Hampshire and South Carolina #Nevadaisforyang #YangGang2020 #YangWillWin #Yang #yangmoneybomb.
remember when you got a generation of black baltimore youth jailed in an attempt to make crime statistics look better so you could run for president and then you got less than half the support of someone like andrew yang and dropped out before like, new hampshire https://twittercom/MartinOMalley/status/1225707489385017344 ….
