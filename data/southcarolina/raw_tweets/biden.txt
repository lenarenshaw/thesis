he'll be history after s carolina  a home bound ride-share with biden.
Should Biden finish third or fourth, he’ll be limping but he won’t necessarily be done He still has a big lead in South Carolina & a slight lead in Nevada, though there is no recent data in the latterhttps://noqreportcom/2020/02/09/joe-biden-falls-to-5th-in-new-hampshire-poll/ ….
he has almost reached planned obsolescence, like pete biden only has to stay in for south carolina, the goal is to prevent bernie from gaining momentum into super tuesday at all cost, so they can rig it for bloomberg.
is it too much to hope that biden says a slur sometime between now and south carolina.
Joe Biden faces competition for black vote in ‘firewall’ South Carolina https://wwwjapantimescojp/news/2020/02/10/world/politics-diplomacy-world/joe-biden-faces-competition-black-vote-firewall-south-carolina/?utm_source=dlvrit&utm_medium=twitter …pictwittercom/RNQxywhnf0.
I wrote in October about how Biden's South Carolina strategy was reminiscent of Giuliani's in 2008 It remains very strange that the attitude of the Biden campaign was, for months, "we don't need to win anything"  https://wwwwashingtonexaminercom/news/win-without-winning-biden-plan-for-losses-in-iowa-and-new-hampshire-has-echoes-of-disastrous-giuliani-2008-strategy ….
biden really has to mention south carolina every few seconds huh.
klobuchar has debate momentum; warren has debate regrets; desperate biden says buttigieg is no obama, and that he'll probably lose again but south carolina and blacks matter sanders will probably win, so second to fifth really matter and here we are, two days til new hampshire.

What are the odds on biden performing badly in new Hampshire, running out of money, and then endorsing Amy before South Carolina? For the good of the country.
I bet biden will drop out if he loses south Carolina.
Just a reminder that not too long ago Biden was leading in South Carolina by 30 points, now he only leads by 5 https://wwwgooglecom/amp/s/thehillcom/homenews/campaign-polls/481071-poll-biden-leads-sanders-by-5-points-in-south-carolina%3famp ….

my (somewhat) hot take is that biden's campaign won't make it to south carolina he's gonna take a massive L in new hampshire, which will exacerbate his inevitable defeat in nevada  donors are probably already beginning to withhold money from what is effectively a sinking ship.

Joe Biden has 18-point lead in South Carolina, new poll shows https://nypostcom/2020/02/26/joe-biden-has-18-point-lead-in-south-carolina-new-poll-shows/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&utm_medium=site%20buttons&utm_campaign=site%20buttons … via @nypost.
If biden can manage 3rd or higher in Nevada, and then win, decisively in SC he’s got a fighting chance  But If Biden doesn’t take 1st in S Carolinait’s over.
yeah absolutely  Polls 10 months out always are the most predictive  Thats why biden still has a 40 pt lead with the black vote in South Carolina  hold on wait.
Its a 4 way race with sanders having slight lead over biden who if he wins south carolina will be come back kid prt2, then bloomberg and warren who will win hom state leaving her in race for awhile after super tuesday.

i think if biden wins south carolina and people drop bloomberg he has a chance of beating bernie i dont really see it otherwise unless they take it from  him in contested convention which could damage the nominee significantly.

Se biden non riesce neanche a vincere south carolina allora é ancora aperta per bloomberg Tutto si basa sulla soglia al 15% per prendere i delegati Se bernie é sopra e tutti gli altri sotto, non ci sono soldi o pubblicitá che tengono.
Bloomberg può arrivare al massimo al 30% di voti nelle primarie secondo me Adesso é al 15% e in crescita Bernie sanders é al 26-27% Se bernie stravince Nevada e arriva primo a parimerito con biden in south carolina, le primarie sono finite ancora prima di super tuesday.

Fun fact: If @joebiden were to win NV and dominate in 3 of the 4 districts that touch LV, he could get 14 delegates If he hit 40% in South Carolina and won all the congressional districts, he'd get approx 34 delegates That would put him at 54 delegates & probably > Sanders.
