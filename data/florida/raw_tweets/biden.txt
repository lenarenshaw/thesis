With pete gone biden is probably gonna over take sanders pictwittercom/4onBFdRocK.
for the love of whatever you love, vote for bernie or we'll end up with biden and he will lose to trump.
He is more a biden type than a sanders type relating to policy.
joe biden has been losing presidential primaries for literally 30 years dude, the thing to learn from pete buttigieg is that you should try to run against people who fucking suck he just objectively did not do very well, the things that won him iowa wont exist in 2024.
I don’t know what group you think is coming out for biden that didn’t come out with hillary and why we wouldn’t get the same result pictwittercom/HaTsVFapJK.
This assuming it’s just biden vs bernie A model with Biden vs bernie and warren probably has biden on top.
hi please don't retweet stuff about joe biden's dead kids into my timeline thanks.
if this motherfucker endorses biden.
Hopefully! I guess I cant see the same moderates who would vote for pete also vote biden, they probably have different bases.

joe biden is a pedophile please god don’t make me vote for him.
i mean we should still be fighting against biden but pete dropping out will also help sanders, he is tied with biden having the most second-choice support from pete supporters.

he successfully ran to the left of clinton  he'll do it again by talking about all the times biden said he wanted to cut social security, medicare, etc  he'll probably mention that obama/biden almost succeeded at it in 2010.
The like single only thing I've liked biden for is undermining obama and coming out and saying he was pro gay marriage before obama did.

Intellectually challenged @joebiden is vulnerable and defenseless against Tulsi's well targeted to the point attacks DNC is fully aware he wouldn't survive the debate Let's hope Bernie can inflict some deep wounds on absolutely pointless biden.
Bernie isn’t a Democrat so he doesn’t care if the democratic party is hurt And a number  of his supporters have already said they have no intention of voting for biden if he is the nominee so I guess they prefer trump.
I feel like the corporate media is setting up joe biden to be the goat in jurassic park  They dont care if he loses, they might even prefer it!    #tytlive.
the gag is biden is only a year younger .
i’ve done a little bit of googling and joe biden seems like a good candidate is there anything bad i should know about him or is he alright??.
tbh that's one of the biggest rays of hope for bernies primary chances biden voters dont give a fuck about biden, they just want a "safe" choice as evidenced by his inability to pull votes from pete, klob, etc without them dropping any big hit to the momentum & "safety" is huge.
need non stop factual ads on biden's record with polling data showing bernie beats Trump at a better margin in florida airing nonstop.
horrifying and hilarious to watch how little biden’s brain works.
Now you are trying to act like “it’s just you trolling “ When you’ve cried about how I should leave biden alone  And you like him Lol That was the first day  I’m just proving you soo wrong Now you are trying to pretend it’s something else lmao.
i feel like a lot of people would turn against her tho if that was the case they would see it as her selling out, especially bernie supporters if he loses the nom policy wise it doesn't really make much sense for her to join with biden when she's been running as "progressive".
A lot of ppl believe biden is the best.
