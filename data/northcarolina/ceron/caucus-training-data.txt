To sane people every vote is a vote Not according to the caucus rules though Satellite caucuses only count towards the statewide delegates (14 of the 41) They don't count towards the 27 district delegates I bet people at the satellite caucus weren't informed about this detail.
Forward, backward, inward, outward Come and join the chase! Nothing could be drier Than a jolly caucus race!.
The Iowa Democratic caucus foreshadowed the road to failure and destruction the democrats are following Neither Bernie nor Buttigieg can win in the General Look at the attributes of the democratic losers over the last fifty years they are similar to the potential losers above.
i truly think they fucked up the iowa caucus bc they wanted THAT to be a bigger deal than bernie winning (it was probably a PR stunt ngl).

I thought we all agreed as a community that Cosby did that shit What is this, the Iowa caucus?.
So what the Iowa caucus taught me this year, is that I need to move to a primary state cause I ain’t got the patience and long suffering in me to be somewhere 2 hrs trying to be a good citizen and it all be for naught.
this is really unprecedented and completely unfair we need closure  bernie should release his numbers for the remaining caucus, if he has them.

nothing to be proud of had the lowest turn out for a democrat caucus The president had the largest turn out and democrats wrote his name in Being communist you will never beat the president, In your years in office you have done nothing for the people or the country.
In any case, I'm thinking that there has never been a fair Iowa caucus I'm also guessing they did this in 2016 but got caught I think that it was awesome Bernie's precinct captains recorded video of the results to get them, and the whole thing unraveled Also exposed them.
Is there a poll of Democrats who don’t live in Iowa asking whether they still care about the caucus? I’m soooooo over it.
The caucus is run by the state so clearly Iowa hates Bernie.
The new caucus winner will be determined by way of the sword.
One state, one caucus and a total shit show What makes anyone think the November elections have any chance of being unadulterated?.
They're going to do this to every caucus Throw a grenade into the middle of every single one, go "bwuhhhhh so mysterious and confusing" and then declare Bloomberg/Buttigieg the ticket.
So I hear Dems caucus didnt turn out as planned so they are going to do it again Maybe they can hurry like they did with the impeachment? @jerome_corsi @trish_Regan @waynedupreeshow @RealDrGina ,@katrinapierson @EricBolling @DLoesch @conservmillen @michellemalkin @deneenborell.
Why were the individual caucus sites responsible for calculating delegates allocated etc? Wouldn't it make more sense to just phone home raw alignment numbers and let literally one IDP staffer with Excel do it?.
The Iowa caucus is in shambles A racist, rapist has taken over the republicans   Maybe it’s a good time we get rid of this 2 party system as shit is definitely broken   #Politics.

But he's not getting any pledged delegates out of Iowa and others are The caucus system is whack, yes, but it is what it is You can have small wins, but if they don't lead to the actual win, then you lose He got 5% of vote That Math ain't good.

Are you referring to the #iowacaucus2020 or the impeached president ya'll let walk? Iowa certainly was unkind to your friend Senator Sanders, it's a great shot redemption for the unkind manner you've treated your friend Mr Sanders with Please clear this up ma'am #corruptpolis.
Ignorance probably  They had 1,700 caucus sites throughout Iowa to report on Tally that by the number of candidates plus the number of their votes put together Data wise we are talking couple of megabytes in data at most from one caucus site All together around 7 gigs of data.

Iowa still isn’t reporting at 100% for the caucus that was 2 days ago, such a mess, get voting machines and do away with caucuses #iowacaucases.
It was cool, seeing all those Hispanic voters, going into Iowa caucus for the first time! And that Muslim caucus also many first timers there! We know because we saw the people out! We also have some results the older vote was down, so Bernie did bring out new voters!.
You do realize the DNC has nothing to do with the Iowa caucus, right? Iowa Dem Party is autonomous You’re yelling at the wrong person.
1/3: Let's say 60 people show up for a precinct caucus with a voting population of 2000 Sally, a big Bernie supporter, gets 19 (totalling 20) of her friends and neighbors to come with her to the caucus, Mayor Pete has 15 show up, Warren 10, Biden 8, Klobuchar 6, Yang 1.

@BretBaier Iowa STILL reporting partial results? The Iowa Democrat Party couldn't have screwed an election up more if it tried, & it's STILL getting screwed up! Don't let them off the hook for total incompetency The entire caucus system is an outdated joke!.
he's coordinating with a super PAC on how to present pete's public persona to caucus voters in nevada - and if what i've read is true, if he did send this as a dm it would've been a violation of campaign finance laws as they pertain to super PACS.
Occum's Razor: the simplest explanation is the most likely one The app that is funded by Buttigieg and has a family/business relationship with the campaign spiked the caucus, just as they spiked the DMR poll Hanlon's Razor has becomes the internet's "but actually".
That’s why I don’t understand why Yang supporters moved to Buttigieg or Klobuchar when huscgroup wasn’t viable at caucus stations They couldn’t be more different.
How, in any way, does this prove that the IDP & Buttigieg campaign rigged the caucuses in Pete’s favor.
Shouldn't your conscious demand you caucus with others who agree "the act [Trump] took" is "as destructive an attack on the oath of office and our Constitution as [he] can imagine"?.

I’m the source I was the designated reporter for my caucus I used the app without issue  You’re not wrong that it was the official reporting tool- but the paper is the official record of the event NOT the app, which was just for reporting.
Iowa caucus voter withdraws vote when she finds out Buttigieg is gay http://amsncom/09/en-ca/BBZFPHX?ocid=st2 …  She has the right to do so.
why can’t you post numbers from all caucus sites on a public facing webpage where the people that were actually there and in charge can see them and verify? TRANSPARENCY.
The cruelest outcome of the whole Iowa caucus is that it makes #PeteButtigieg think he stands a chance of winning anything in the rest of the states, which he doesn't.
Honestly once you figure out how the federal elections work, it’s not incredibly difficult to get the state elections The caucus system is absolutely broken though.
So is it about IA caucus not wanting Bernie to win, or Pete corruption, or both? I am intrigued by this whole thing.
Careful, huh? Like the Iowa caucus.
The guy whose company built the app that tanked the Iowa Caucus wants you to know he feels really, really bad about the whole ordeal https://wwwhuffpostcom/entry/gerard-niemira-shadow-app-iowa-caucus_n_5e3adc16c5b6d032e76d08ca?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 … via @HuffPostPol.
Sorry what I mean is if Iowa had a primary instead of a caucus he would be in third or fourth place Caucuses are super favorable to him (that's why he never came out against them even though they are trash) Also isnt he only 900 votes ahead on PV??.
[doom/gloom] I feel like no matter what happens from here no one's going to /trust/ the results of the caucus Like, not even necessarily just in a "conspiracy" sense, just "if they're this sloppy with the data how can there be any confidence that the rest of it is accurate".
This is why GOP shut down primaries against Trump: GOP voters can then vote for the Democrat least likely to beat Trump This is why the Iowa BS caucus results are what they are: GOP are burying Biden for a reason YES, WAKE UP https://twittercom/blakesmustache/status/1225115700148293632 ….
Yeah I mean, it was a good clap back It may have even distracted a bit from the fact that the DNC is rigging the Iowa caucus to hurt Bernie Sanders   Otherwise, totally useless.
If a conspiracy has occurred it is entirely to cast the entire caucus into doubt The damage is already done, no one - no matter the results - is going to trust the results Furthermore, whoever does win won't be able to truly capitalize on it #iowacaucases.
La verdad la tipa es ignorante! No existe comparación!Respecto al voto electrónico hoy es menos viable (si es que lo fue)Lo que paso en el caucus de IOWA!

Caucuses are probably the hardest elections to cook the books on because everybody present at each caucus location knows the results because the totals are public I'd be more worried about the New Hampshire primary There is NO way statistically Hillary's crocodile tears won '08.
I am all for accessibility, which is why I want absentee ballots What I am ridiculing is the absurdity of the whole satellite caucus process Rather than having a whole special event for seven people, just give them a ballot.
the iowa caucus shitshow is actually really good for me bc i’ve been running out of excuses why i can’t visit my extremely devout and bigoted family in des moines this could work.

I deeply need there to be an Always Sunny caucus episode.
But are they really “votes” missing? Aren’t they more like “feelings”? A caucus death knell is a silver lining.
fair, she lost! But a caucus leader can only shape the caucus so much These days, as Ds shit their pants begging for deals with Trump, she's blocked defections and forced Trump errors in ways others haven't subtle but significant and unclear to me what the better alternative is.

You people should not only lose your first caucus slot; you should lose the right to vote at all  Utter ridiculousness.
The fact that it’s a caucus played well for Sanders I actually think Warren should have had a better showing to show any semblance of a campaign that could more than one focused in the north given her low numbers in the South (Sanders regardless of NH has no chance there).
would like to point out that the "votes" tab on google's caucus tracker is actually displaying state delegate equivalents, not popular votes not sure if this was an oversight or a deliberate attempt to mislead the public pictwittercom/C4HOJm9LqT.
No one has a clue really It boils down to, Iowa democrats got this app to keep up with votes in the caucus, and didn't bother to test it All hell broke loose Pete declared a victory, and the dems released some of the results, then said they werent correct, now it's even worse.

The popular vote in a caucus is meaningless, since such a small potion of the electorate actually participates.
How long are these Iowa results going to trickle in? 62% now 72% this is the United States of America!! Worn torn countries count ballots faster The caucus was Monday guys at this rate New Hampshire will come in quicker!!.
Kirk Douglas died from an acute lack of Iowa caucus results Seriously though RIP in peace to a legend.
@OKnox Ruth Sherman, I disagree After caucus craziness & impeachment craziness, the warm human moments at SOTU are exactly what we need.

yep, @davidaxelrod and @ChrisCuomo both claimed that #MayorCheat "won" the Iowa caucus yesterday on @CNN .
Why are there only 86% of the Iowa caucus results in The #DemsAreCorrupt just like their partisan impeachment #Walkaway #PartyOfHate #nhpolitics.
Fits in especially w/the HS girls all dressing in the same white hoping everyone will notice them Most immature spectacle I have ever witnessed by a Congressional House which believes it can govern IA caucus was 1st hole in the dike which now will continue to sweep away the DNC.
Congrats to Iowa on holding the first quantum caucus: all results exist at the same time.
Mueller & 20 of Hilly's henchmen said NO collusion  but u better check out  the collysion with Russia & the avowed  Communist Sandersand how about the black caucus members who r registered as members of the New Communist Party of the United States& have been for years!.
Jackson Lee house satancrat claims Russia hacked the Iowa caucus.
Because he isn’t the winner yet and it looks like he will tie with Sanders on national delegates and have a lower total vote count, because he had a financial tie with the firm that screwed up the vote count &  satellite caucuses which are predominantly POC haven’t been counted.
Has Iowa caucus missed chance to be relevant? https://youtube/JfnI3kUMs0U  via @YouTube.
I want the coin flip guys caucus results struck from the records.
I beg to differ with McConnell   The actions of his party's caucus in the Senate are a stain on the Republican Party  To vote in such a Partisan manner without challenging or deposing known first hand witnesses is a travesty to justice and against our country  Shame on them.
In the midst of the #IowaCaucas remember this  The GOP is not allowing anyone but trump on their caucus or primary ballot in several states  We are watching Democrats make sausage and it will be much more flavorful than the GOP's dry white toast.
The most alarming thing for me is concerning Buttigieg: people aren't questioning how in the actual fart he's not polling anywhere close to even Warren, yet he manages to beat the frontrunner going into the caucus and he wins??  Definitely DNC damage control to purge Biden.
I don’t mind at all going full tilt into conspiracy theories Russiagate, Ukrainegate, impeachment, election interference, democracy, constitution!!! For 3yrs running now I’ve been listening to conspiracy chatter Biden/Burisma, Iowa caucus=unmitigated corruption! Call it a !!.
How long does it take to rig the caucus? We wont let you get away with this.
if folks are catching so many errors with the caucus results-- regular folks, not DNC goons-- how on earth are we supposed to trust results of primary votes that can't be verified and validated by eye-witness accounts?.
I understand that candidate Andrew Yang blamed the president for the glitches in the Iowa caucuses Be honest if the RNC was helping the DNC on this the results would’ve come in smooth Maybe Andrew is not quite ready for primetime.
The young skew of this caucus relative to previous ones in the same site is information about whose supporters are motivated to turn out and whose aren’t.

No The demographics disadvantaged by the caucus format are much less favorable to Bernie than caucus demographics That's why he pushed so hard for them in the reform committee, not some high-minded principal.
The Democrat presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg paid the firm that reportedly built the failed Iowa caucus app that partly rendered the results of the caucus Yea rigging the primary worked wonders for the Democrats last time.

Part of the reason  Probably not all In 2008 esp there were virtual experiments; the Texas primary/caucus where Obama did better in the caucus segment and some states had caucus and primary on different days and he did better in caucuses.
True I'm glad Warren was viable when I caucused because the behavior of the Sanders group when Klobuchar and Biden didn't reach viability was very rude - precinct chair had to loudly reprimand them I don't support Buttigieg either so I probably would have gone uncommitted.
Klobuchar=1? Seriously?  Time to end Iowa caucuses.

I'll bet it helped Andrew for so many voters to come out to the caucus & see the Yang support Probably half of them thought he'd dropped out, due to the media blackout They voted for someone else, but on the way home they were probably wishing they'd gone Yang on the 1st ballot.

Every time I hear about that particular issue as it affects POTUS elections, it seems to always contain comments about how IA does NOT reflect the Democratic electorate "across the nation" They need to get real, deep-six the caucus and go w/primary elections & paper ballots.

True  If the network had enough contacts on the ground they could also just bypass the #CorruptDNC and their garbage APP and release preliminary results themselves Most precincts write results on a giant whiteboard at the end of the caucus #IowaCaucus.
1 Most delegates are apportioned on a precinct basis, not statewide (though there are those delegates,too) Same as in 2016 2 Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who lobbied hard after 2016 in favor of caucuses 3 The problem w/caucuses is that they’re *undemocratic* 4 .
A nonsense argument If 91% of all voters are white, and 91% of all caucus attendees were white, then it follows that white people caucused proportionately and were no more apathetic to the process than other races Why do white folks have more of a burden to vote than other races.

Yeah but it's a caucus Caucuses are intentionally anti-democratic.
It’s so obvious trump paid Putin to hack the Iowa caucus app!!! Come on Adam start an investigation and impeach him for this constitutional crisis Putin is everywhere at the direction of king trump.

Well have to admit Iowa caucus’ going about as smoothly as some of the expense approval processes at my former employer  Best probably when system decided to swallow entry lineseverything looked legit when I hit enter, my boss approved without checking.
Bernie lost the Iowa caucus.
Another rigged Iowa caucus?.
Execution is everything If you can't execute a caucus in February, how are going to orchestrate a presidential victory in November?.
Someone on your network last night said low turn out numbers can also indicate too many undecided voters  They aren’t as motivated when they aren’t totally sold on a candidate, especially in a caucus state Didn’t the last polling say 40% were still undecided?.
If you think the Shadow/ACRONYM caucus app is unbelievable you’re going to love Andrew Yang He had his own scammy fake-tech non-profit with similar people but it didn’t just fail terribly it also drove people to suicide.
Chiming in as former Iowa caucus goer, it's most likely because if your candidate is not viable in the first alignment you have to pick a viable candidate to side with (You could also technically switch if your candidate was viable too, but most movement would happen from.

1 Agree to disagree I don't see Bernie winning as an independent, cuz he'd get even less media coverage   2 And Bernie lead tons of polls before the caucus, lead the popular vote in the results we have now, and (allegedly) will pass Pete when the rest are released.

We can’t even trust the Democrats with the caucus app, how are they supposedly run the country?! #IowaCaucas #IowaCaucusDisaster #IowaCaucuses2020.
well, this caucus was clearly not liking the moderate and experienced contingent Which is just so stupid it was painful to type.
The DNC had nothing to do with WA eliminating their Dem caucuses That was grassroots WA Dem voters really angry after 2016.
Maybe they can find another industry so that we can have a 1st primary/caucus that is more representative of the electorate?!?.
Idk what's funnier, Pete buttigieg declaring victory after Iowa caucus or all the Bernie Bros who are really triggered by Pete buttigieg declaring his victory.
31st NOT 1st That's it for Iowa No more going first in the Dem primaries/caucuses No more skewing the electoral process toward an non-representative population Iowa needs to vote 31st in line- which is their ranking in population in the US Enough is enough #31stNOT1stpictwittercom/QQvScmOrQW.
Maybe the real problem with the caucus is we can't spell caucus WTH people?!.

The real Iowa caucus was the friends we made along the way.
I think a lot of Republicans have simply disregarded him because, even after winning the IA caucus, they don’t think he’s a threat You’ll probably see a lot more disliking of him now.
Your grasses roots are dead  Nothing is growing  240ish voters in the STATE of Iowa caucus support you .
This is not the first time this has happened at an Iowa caucus Hopefully the last; Iowa is so yesterday There is, though, a paper trail, backups to the system, built-in redundancies Yeah Price and Perez are assholes But anyone pointing to this as a cheat is full of it.
Iowa caucus results indicate that white rural Midwesterners like white males with (mostly) a more conservative viewpoint  Why am I not surprised.
Exactly why it is important - and correct - for Iowa caucus officials to take the time to get the results right - AND ignore media demands and campaign staffers Last night many staffers, and even some veteran pundits were out of line childish.

1 I'm not a Pete supporter 2 You're spreading misinformation 3 The company released what each payment was for from each campaign 4 Your candidates camp supported maintaining the caucus format, with complicated rule changes, over the "establishment" wanting an straight primary.
@NateSilver538 how does Biden poll well but finish 4th in the caucus? I just never see supporters for him with the same fervor that the ither candidates seem to draw Thoughts?.
Get rid of that stupid caucus!.
LOL omg what's happening w masai tho??? Fuck I need more caucus info NOW.
The DNC, which doesn't run elections in Iowa, was very clever to fix the Iowa caucuses to place Biden in 4th Exactly where he wants to be!.

True, although iirc even in the Iowa caucus polls specificially he was doing way worse than this.
For the price of a depressing date somewhere in the middle of Iowa, an caucus staffer can give you a half-hearted hand job  Oh wait I'm describing what's actually happened in Iowa.
So like Does anyone know what happened w the caucus Maybe it's the sleepiness but I have no idea what the hell is going on.
the REAL question is whether we'll see troy price's resignation letter before or after the caucus results at this rate, it's before.
Bernie fought to keep the caucus It's well documented He got the caucus   My advice: don't take Bernie to the racetrack.

your obviously triggered over another failed coup, the embarrassing Iowa caucus debacle, tonight's State of the Union Address, and Trumps all time approval rating high hit today all this should tell you, you're on the wrong side of history here but you can believe what you like.
Completely wrong Early voting results are transmitted to the caucus app and included in the calculations for viability, live, after round one Otherwise the viability calculations are incomplete and incorrect Early voters will indicate first 3 choices, to be used for round 2.
The voting app that Iowa was using to report caucus numbers shit the bed, so now dem leadership is reporting their numbers county-by-county over the phone Roughly 62% of results reported @CNN acting like Pete has won outright.
It just seems weird that candidates are allowed to visit caucus locations.
TFW you're kinda sorta keeping an eye on this Iowa caucus business but not really because you've already decided you'll literally vote for the bone-eating worm attached to a dead and rotting whale carcass if that's the candidate running against Trump.
Trying to "modernize" the Iowa caucus with a mobile app is like trying to run Red Dead Redemption 2 on your Pentium 5.
When it comes to caucuses, especially Iowa, the media has always used the delegate count to declare the victor Because that is effectively who “wins” in this system  Caucuses are undemocratic Sanders actually benefited from this in 2016 https://twittercom/SjwSpiderman/status/1224826616200736770 ….

They just plain old cheatin thanks for exposing how BS the Iowa caucus really is.
Hilarious that some media outlets feel that a difference in the original vote of about 7,000 in Iowa based upon who was willing to hang around and caucus until after midnight somehow determines who should be our Democratic Party nominee in a country of over 80 million Democrats.
That’s true, but it should also be noted that the Sanders campaign fight hard to keep as many caucuses as possible, so this is the system they wanted to run in.

Sanders actually won the Iowa caucus he has more votes but to be fair they took some of his votes and gave them to the other candidates who didn’t have very many .
This is just how quick liberals turn on their own party there is no UNITY amongst them, they cannot even properly run a caucus  y’all are despicable.
*looking at caucus data that's finally out* this seems good for Bernie?.
Incidentally, the only homophobia I’ve come across with relation to the Iowa caucus was a white lady who, when she found out that Pete was married to a man, demanded her caucus vote card for him be returned to her.

Just remember if the caucus dispute goes to the Supreme Court they’ll award the delegates to trump .
The Iowa caucus debacle and recriminations, I submit to you, is just more proof that Trump is not the one falling apart under pressure We are  Also, that our electoral tech for 2020 is vulnerable  #justsayin.
@WatchingHawks  Results should not be released until 100% if votes are counted Also a coin toss to decide winners of a Presidential caucus is not democracy  #IowaCaucusDisaster #BernieSanders #Bernie2020.
That would basically just be a primary then instead of a caucus    But then again, a caucus is essentially a primary where you get to change your vote in the next round if your guy doesn't get enough support  So primaries with run-off elections.

Pretty clear from the numbers that Biden being non-viable after first rounds considerably helped Buttigieg I knew those “Bernie is my second choice” numbers would not be reflective on caucus day Also, it seems unlikely that Yang’s people went for Sanders very often.

Bernie and his supporters love, love, love the caucus system and fought to keep this undemocratic voting system in place  Now that he may not win, you're not liking it so much  Boo hoo.
The Iowa caucus is a good indicator of how incompetent the attempts to screw progressives are going to be, but also how it's likely going to work given how much money is on the line and how little the pundit class cares So we get to see the dumbest conspiracy in history unfold.

youre about to shit a brick they literally mentioned that today this morning around 9 or 10 and how the early results were wrong and how it was over turned two weeks later in reference to the current iowa caucus chaos lol.
TURNOUT should be concerning in the Iowa caucus.
The only reason he won: you've already rigged the caucus in the first place in a level field , i have a feeling it would be vastly different but the GOP is too cowardly to allow competition.
Iowa caucuses are irrelevant to the reality of this election Iowa fleeced the Democratic presidential candidates for the past yearhundreds of visits, millions of dollars, and came up short, with a complete mess Perez must dispatch monitoring crew in advance to each primary.
We need to dismantle it and toss it on the trash heap of history! The enormous sums of $ & time wasted is egregious Do a lottery for first primary! And lose the caucus model - people should vote in private and not be subject to BS group think.

My pet peeve is people who can't figure out farm land while flying over it  By the way, Iowa caucus turn out was LOW.
Problem is that the nomination process that is what the primaries/caucuses are a part of are dictated by the parties and  state law (at least in WA) In addition in WA we still have the primary AND caucus and it’s up to the parties which results they use.
I don’t see how he can without placing his finger on scale It’s to early 1 caucus in But when he does it’ll help stabilize things most def.
We agree voters deserve a system that's error free and auditable Paper primary FTW But human error is not election fraud, and the caucus did have a flaw in it's design in that inconsistencies can be unreconcilable after the fact Systems need to account for human error.

1/2 You’re not paying attention  There’s a reason that Trump followers are prepping to vote for Sanders in states that have open primaries  There’s a reason why the RNC paid people to jam Democrats’ caucus phone lines in Iowa.
Not really, Bernie supporters just don't like him He lied a lot, his record as mayor is terrible, he has donated money to the infamous iowa voting app, he has a staffer at the NH caucus Bernie supporters don't like him just like they don't like Trump, both lie are are corrupt.

Makes me sick to see people be influenced by the Iowa caucus that only represents 1% of the vote and a prominently white state.
Iowacan't tabulate caucus results, can't attach signage properly to a lectern Ehwhatever  It is what it is Let's just get this primary over with tomorrow and move on Please  #msnbc #thebeat.
Lifelong Iowan here: I was ready to give up the caucus even before last week I had a really good, well run caucus experience this year and still would rather have a primary.
Iowa caucus hit the ground like a safe .
MSM will start say how wonderful / powerful klobuchar is  she will be all over msm in good ways  she is moderate compared to sanders/Pete  warren has zero credibility  and dnc will push klobuchar   she will win contested caucus by picking Hillary Clinton as vp.
