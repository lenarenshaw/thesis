South Carolina GOP Tells Republicans to Vote for Bernie in Democratic Primary https://wwwlibertyheadlinescom/south-carolina-republicans-vote-sanders/ … via @LibertyHeadline Has South Carolina GOP gone nutsI pray many Ppl from South Carolina read this and not be instigated by such and absurd statement.

Who is making the arguement that sanders is polling ahead, or going to win South Carolina?.
sanders is trying to translate his momentum from wins in NH and Nevada (where Pete is powerless) into a win in SC Biden is falling hard all over the place and with momentum + Bernie's ground game in SC, he hopes to deliver a stunning South Carolina win.
Here’s the thing-Lots of great candidates to split vote and push Bernie w/ GOP backing him:”Although the South Carolina GOP had canceled its own primary, Leupp said the move to support Sanders “can still help Trump win” https://wwwnationalreviewcom/news/south-carolina-gop-plans-to-boost-sanders-to-influence-dem-primary/amp/ ….

There is a reason the GOP in South Carolina is urging republicans to vote for sanders in the open primary and it’s not bc they like him https://wwwpostandcouriercom/politics/upstate-gop-leaders-plotting-to-impact-sc-democratic-primary-by/article_f1e7abd2-4788-11ea-aa9f-33a1d262994chtml … .
you're putting a whole lot of faith in a bunch of polls that have been conducted before any attacks have begun  wait until there have been 6 months of ads featuring a shirtless bernie sanders partying in soviet russia and then check the polls.
Pete is going to get the buzzsaw in South Carolina Biden May have a few wins in the New England area, do great in the south, but fizzle out west Warren will split sanders vote.
klobuchar has debate momentum; warren has debate regrets; desperate biden says buttigieg is no obama, and that he'll probably lose again but south carolina and blacks matter sanders will probably win, so second to fifth really matter and here we are, two days til new hampshire.
“Republicans are preparing to vote for the socialist in what The Post and Courier reports will be a ‘wide-scale effort this week to encourage GOP voters across South Carolina to vote for US Sen Bernie Sanders in the Feb 29 Democratic  primary’” https://wwwthedailybeastcom/the-trumpists-boosting-bernie-sanders-might-get-what-they-wish-for-and-regret-it ….
But it’s still abundantly clear that Trump&his R supporters are itching to run against Sanders In South Carolina, in fact, the GOP has launched an operation to help Sanders win that primary election and run away with the nomination https://wwwpoliticususacom/2020/02/08/joy-reid-warns-democrats-theyll-be-handing-florida-to-trump-if-sanders-is-nomineehtml … via @politicususa.

sanders winning nevada is expected, it won't give him any momentum unless the margin is surprising  if biden takes second in nevada, then first in south carolina, the biden rebirth narrative is obvious.

just the most delegates by a pretty large margin Biden has been losing ground in south carolina and isn't projected to win ANY south state by Nate Silver and fivethirtyeight polling   Warren may not drop out but will likely give her delegates to sanders, Bloomberg wont drop out.
how? first choice among warren voters is sanders, pete is polling below 10% in California! Biden might be around 15% IF he wins south carolina, which is looking like its not a given with Bernie within the margin of error Biden has also had tons of contributors abandon him.

absolutely i think that if both tulsi and warren drop, then that could seal up a sanders nomination obviously tulsi is much more likely to drop out soon, but hopefully warren underperforms in nevada and south carolina and sees the writing on the wall.

by "diverse" they meant south carolina because they knew sanders would win this they're going to claim sanders can't win the african american vote after this the real question is how they respond when he does.
caucuses? notoriously good for white voters   i hear sanders is busing in illegals from the border, yes that's why he won   this doesn't matter at all, south carolina is where the real primary begins.
If sanders win Nevada I think that he could build momentum enough to win  SC and the Super Tuesday dont you think?? nowwhat willl the superdelegates do?.
