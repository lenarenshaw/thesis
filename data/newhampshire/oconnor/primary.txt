The last thing we need is all the people who dropped out to start coming back in This primary is STILL too crowded with at least over 10 people still in the race Hopefully more will drop out after Iowa and New Hampshire.

Kassandra, it seems to me that Bernie will do well in caucus states like Iowa and Nevada because his base are bullies  Do you think he will be as much of a threat in primary states like New Hampshire?.
Voters in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary are more likely to be whiter, older, and comprised of more noncollege whites than primary voters in other states: https://brookgs/2Ud2AXb pictwittercom/5ACVIsYtkI.

No they’re not, ideally more diverse states should go first But there’snno denying the historical impact Iowa has had on the rest of the primary If Bernie wins there, he wins New Hampshire, and then he probably wins Nevada too He’s then the favorite to be the nominee.
I've never lived anywhere where anyone cared about my vote really, but here's life in New Hampshire before the primary: I'm standing in my doorway talking to two #Bernie2020 canvassers while a Warren campaigner paces in the street waiting her turn It's going to be a busy week.
I believe New Hampshire has a law that they'll schedule theirs before any other primary no matter how early it is.
The winner of the Iowa caucus and/or New Hampshire primary has won the nomination every election for the past 20 nominees Very telling.
Just came from meeting awesome staffers and volunteers in Derry and Exeter   9 days until the New Hampshire primary Get on a bus and GOTV next weekend!.
Yes, there is a lot happening news-wise — impeachment, the Iowa caucus, the State of the Union, the New Hampshire primary, etc   ALSO THIS: President Trump is expanding his travel ban   Thanks to the @nytimes's @KannoYoungs for the important update: https://onmsnbccom/2S9rnc0 .

(Sorta) Bold Prediction: After the New Hampshire primary, Tulsi Gabbard is going to drop out of the race and join Bernie's campaign.
@AlexWitt How in the world are WY, ID, & all the virtually all White states more important than states where Blacks live? The Electoral College (EC) The DNC mirrors the EC & goes further by beginning its primary in Iowa & New Hampshire I urge all Blacks to protest & not vote!.
They've gone through "maybe if we all get together behind one candidate" and already given up on that After New Hampshire comes anger, after Super Tuesday, bargaining Acceptance will occur in 2024 when everyone agrees it makes no sense to primary the president for reelection.
they have one week to deploy this line because bernie's going to win the new hampshire primary by a lot.
Watch as   Corporate media discounts the results of the Iowa caucus  Corporate media discounts the results of the New Hampshire primary  Corporate media discounts    Rinse, lather Repeat.
Trump will head back to the campaign trail starting with a rally in New Hampshire on Feb 10 the night before the  primary race, and will upstage the Democrats as we try to pick a nominee to face him in the fall Then Trump will destroy any candidate that's less than perfect.

America should just have three primary days and divide it into 16, 18, 16 states The idea that Iowa and New Hampshire have this much power is just upsetting.
I'll explainIn every primary in history, the first person to win 2 of the first 3 states, wins the nomination  Iowa is religious right, New hampshire is liberal, and South Carolina is conservative with a lot of black vote  It's a good representation of the entire US.
This is exactly what infuriates me! Same as having the first primary votes in Iowa and New Hampshire No offense, but they don’t represent the diversity of America  We’ve got a lot to fix when this national nightmare is over.
New Hampshire likes them, because they allow NH to maintain the illusion that NH is the first primary.
Hillary Clinton will be on Ellen next Monday (aka the day before the New Hampshire primary) https://wwwinterbridgecom/lineupshtml .

Yes However, New Hampshire objected bc they get to be the first primary, and they argued the Iowa proposal was too close to a primary, so we had to scrap it  Neera got really pissed when I pointed this our before, but I don't make the rules.
I don’t want to get ahead of myself but I can’t even imagine what New Hampshire is going to look like if Bernie is doing this well in Iowa Are we going to get double digit primary victories in the first two contests? .
Bernie won New Hampshire by double digits and lost the primary by 4 million votes  Biden is still polling double digits with black voters If Bernie wants to win the nomination he’s going to have to win white voters in every state by a huge margin Not gonna happen.
Iowa and New Hampshire should develop real identities instead of this primary/caucus shit.
Another way to look at Iowa: it's roughly 3 Rhode Islands  And New Hampshire is 13 Rhode Islands  I say it again: RI should hold the first primary in 2024!.
if you want to ignore all of the polling this close to when ballots are being cast, go ahead But it's not looking very good for her in iowa and new hampshire  But what are you considering bashing? I know i've been pretty critical of policy differences, but it's a primary.
No Iowa and New Hampshire never tell us anything about who's going to be the nominee South Carolina is the first primary state that actually tells us anything.
In the modern primary era, every Democrat who won both Iowa and New Hampshire went on to win the nomination Bill Clinton is the only Democrat to win the nomination without winning either Iowa or New Hampshire.
The New Hampshire primary on Feb 11 will be the clearest indicator.
Nevada as a primary not caucus should go first Diverse, small and inexpressive ads so people can get to know the candidates New Mexico and Arizona are good back ups as well as Virginia No way Iowa’s and New Hampshire so go first.
About Bernie Sanders winning the goddamn Iowa Caucus and New Hampshire primary despite every @AP newspaper declaring war on his candidacy #NotMeUs #PresidentSanders #Bernie #StrongerTogether #Bernie2020.
Let's see what happens AFTER  Iowa and New Hampshire   it's not that we can't find those great states on a map  we can!   Good luck to all the Dems!   But most voters are not from there, so we're chompin' at the bit to get on with the rest of the Dems' primary season.
He’s leading in Iowa He’s leading in New Hampshire He’s leading in California   He’s caught up to within the MOE nationally of Biden  Biden has never one a single presidential primary Not a one Bernie won 23 last time around.
Joe already hinted it  Probably get more press around the New Hampshire primary if Joe can make it that far.

On a more serious note, I tried doing this with the GOP primary and if my calculator works with that (I’m suspicious as I have no heavily lopsided primaries to test it with) Trump will get 94% in Iowa and 84% in New Hampshire Personally I think Trump will do better though https://twittercom/Alec_Holbeck/status/1223428028811874304 ….

Simple He's got a very high chance of winning in Iowa and he's nearly guaranteed to win in New Hampshire and Nevada I could be wrong, but I don't believe anyone has ever failed to secure the nomination after winning 3 of the first 4 primary states.

Bernie is ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire and gaining in Nevada There has been nothing consistent about any polls regarding Dems I agree with you that he is popular with the black Democratic primary voters but his worry would be the General Election ￼￼￼.

The most disappointing thing about covering the lead-up to the primary in New Hampshire is that I will be missing the @WKCDOGS Westminster Kennel Club  Show in NYC this year.
If the Democrats are putting a lot of hope on Collins and Romney voting for witnesses they may do it but is the Democrat Senators running for the Nomination like Bernie and Warren going to vote yes and risk missing the Iowa Caucus and New Hampshire primary?.
Iowa ond New Hampshire are caucus states, a vicious holdover from undemocratic times Look to the primary states for what Democrats want.

Nice treatment of Iowa and New Hampshire, and the history of these contests Iowa switched to a primary once, in 1916, but state leaders thought it cost too much, there was low turnout, and not enough candidates partook, so they gave it up The governor called it "a farce".
It is odd that states that are essential for the primary decisions are almost meaningless in the general elections  At this rate Iowa should be moved to Michigan and new Hampshire should be moved to Wisconsin.

Minnesota did this all sneaky like by switching from a caucus to a primary and allowing early voting before Iowa and New Hampshire This was done entirely to spite Iowa.
One reason is that New Hampshire has a law to protect its first-in-the-nation status If any state tries to move their primary to an earlier date, New Hampshire automatically moves their primary to at least 7 days before that.

Looking at the primary schedule from now til super tuesday, think it works out like this  bernie: New Hampshire Massachusetts Minnesota  Vermont Utah Colorado Maine  Biden: South Carolina Tennessee Oklahoma Arkansas North Carolina.
New Hampshire I believe has their primary set to be at least 7 days before any other states primary (Iowa is a caucus not primary) So this would be complicated unless we decided to do the same and just have it the same day but I’m good with Super Tuesday.
The Iowa Caucuses are blown far out of proportion There is no way they should be given the importance they have The same can be said for the New Hampshire primary.
Can the Iowa caucus and new Hampshire primary happen so we can go back to not pretending that they matter?.
Does anyone need any coverage from the New Hampshire primary? I will ask everyone about Andy Griffith.

If your candidate is heading into Iowa and they aren't in the top 4, it's going to be a short primary for you  If your candidate isn't in the top 3 heading into New Hampshire, it's time to start talking about who your second choice is.
Interestingly, New Hampshire has only 13% black population  That means the two earliest primary states are disproportionately white vs almost every other state  Overall, I think it is worth considering the voices of people of color.
New Hampshire primary is open This is a year there is no real opposition to Trump  They are going to be voting in the Dems primary to pick their opposition.

Oh, you said Democratic primary That's less clear   Whoever wins Iowa loses New Hampshire Joe Biden wins South Carolina It's May before a nominee begins to emerge  If nominee is Bernie Sanders, Democrats struggle to get turnout, but slate of great Senate candidates helps.

I’ll play for fun: Biden 2nd (to Bernie) in Iowa and New Hampshire Little to no trouble for him the rest of the way Pete, who I hope to vote for in PA, will likely have dropped out before that primary If Biden wins in Iowa, it could get out of hand quick.
Warren will be the nominee Biden will falter by New Hampshire Bernie is too crazy, will be thwarted by DNC Warren is socialist enough for radical Dem primary base, and is a stand in for Hillary’s revenge for the Resist crowd.
I’m very much looking forward to the Hampshire primary An excellent indicator of who will win the Labor nomination for PM.
I think the states that will make Andrew Yang come out strong in this primary isnt Iowa or New Hampshire.

Biden absolutely will not be the nominee He's failed 3 primary runs already, never once garnering above 22% Sanders will win Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada In modern political history, no candidate has done that and failed to get the nomination.
I read that as where the write-in occurredas that is where the name appears by act of writing it on there   From what I have read elsewhere it is only an open primary for non-affiliated people which is something like 42% of the people in New Hampshire.
I guess it would be kind of funny and pointed if Tulsi won the Republican primary in New Hampshire  I am pretty sure the write-ins on the Republican ballot will count towards the Republican primary  The wording says they will not be added together  That is key.

 US DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES   With the Iowa caucus now only days away, we think it's time to unveil our predictions for Iowa and the New Hampshire primary   IA - too close to call, leaning toward Sanders NH - Sanders win  What do you think?  #USPrimaries2020pictwittercom/Z9Vmw2CdQ4.
HonestlyI think people are freaking out a bit too much about Iowa and New Hampshire (both of which should be moved back primary wise) They don't represent the Democratic base as a whole South Carolina, etc will be a better indicator.
personally i dont think new hampshire should be allowed to call itself a "first in the nation primary" when they're a week after iowa this is my only political position.
Colorado voters will be able to cast their presidential primary ballots on the same day as New Hampshire’s http://bitly/36xbcdB  #copolitics.

A candidate must get over 15% in a district to get any delegates This poll suggests that everyone except Bernie Sanders will miss out on delegates in most districts in New Hampshire primary and if the Bernie surge continues, he could take a majority of the delegates https://twittercom/Politics_Polls/status/1222230960487485441 ….

Starting the primary off with a flip is a MASSIVE boon for Sanders Winning New Hampshire (perhaps being the only candidate even scoring delegates there) will help him even further Biden will probably win SC, but if you think it will be anywhere NEAR 2016 margins you are foolish.
New Hampshire Democratic Presidential Preference Primary https://americanresearchgroupcom/pres2020/primary/dem/nhdem20-01html ….
The 15% threshold that everyone has been talking about regarding the Iowa Caucus applies to ALL states  New Hampshire (which by the way is an OPEN primary) and all states thereafter require candidates reach the 15% threshold to receive ANY Delegates.
Folks, THE TRAILER is going from three days a week to DAILY from here through the New Hampshire primary   Naturally, I am tackling this by adding a new section and making it longer.
"Sample Size: 600 completed telephone interviews among a random sample of likely Democratic primary voters living in New Hampshire (335 Democrats and 265 undeclared voters (independents)" It's at a 4% margin of error will at 600, closer to 6% with jsut Democrats.

This is a problem waiting for a solution: the Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary, and the Nevada primary  There is no point speculating whether he can get out the vote  Let's just see.

Bernie Sanders holds a 7-point lead over Joe Biden and a 13-point advantage over a slumping Elizabeth Warren in New Hampshire just two weeks before the first-in-the-nation primary, a new Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald-NBC10Boston poll reveals  https://wwwlowellsuncom/2020/01/27/bernie-sanders-surges-as-joe-biden-liz-warren-slump-in-latest-poll-2/ ….

You're welcome! I may not support Yang but he's polling way higher than this in New Hampshire and he'll probably do pretty well in the primary 1% is just out of touch with reality.

You know, and this is fact, that you can't win an election without maximal support from Blacks Winning Iowa & New Hampshire only gives Sanders some momentum He has other primary/caucus states which will be more than a challenge for him And Iowa does not predict an election.
In the past 50 years only one primary contestant in both parties has won without either winning Iowa or New Hampshire- Bernie is currently on track to win both.
Wait okay so if New Hampshire has in its constitution that it must have the first presidential primary in the country, and then another state also puts that in their constitution, what, uh, happens?.
They're simply publicly trashing Joe Biden prior to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary Of course, they have no proof of anything, all of it's been investigated, but most people aren't paying attention  #BidenDriveBy.
I can’t wait for Tom Steyer to get absolutely waxed in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary so we can stop being bombarded with his cringy commercials.

at the end of the day Bernie is not a democrat Iowa is a caucus New Hampshire is an open primary  Even if we gift wrap Bernie a 2 touchdown lead the majority of Democrats are not voting for him He will still lose #MorningJoe Joe Biden.
Can we say we won't vote in the primary for a candidate because simply just don't like the person? Policy aside, past votes aside Just don't like him/her I also think this Iowa/New Hampshire historic record superstition thing of determining the candidate is overrated.
   Btw, you do know Yang will drop out after New Hampshire or South Carolina right? There is no chance he gets any delegates in the early states or even breaks 5% So if you live outside of IA, NH, NV or SC, and you want to vote in the primary, you should have a number 2.

And I will say the same about New Hampshire, probably one of a few of the whitest states in our union  Having Iowa and New Hampshire as the first primary voting states gives a very skewed look at how the rest of the states will vote  #MorningJoe.
It's a ridiculous system where Iowa and New Hampshire have so much power in selecting the candidate  We need a national primary #MorningJoe.

What do you think about changing the first Democratic primary day to include Iowa, Nevada, South Carolina, and New Hampshire? Four regions, four different demographics Thinking Iowa has way too much influence and power over this process.
I swear this is true   I had a dream Thursday, that @BernieSanders won the New Hampshire primary and as it was being announced it went something like "after winning in Iowa, Senator Sanders has pulled off an a second victory in a row"  Was a great dream, I hope it comes true.

Right? This is the "once every four years we're forced to care about Iowa and New Hampshire" game   It would make more sense to either have all states primary/caucus on the same day OR start with a large diverse state like California.
I’m not sure if that’s the case, but if does Bernie win Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, then the primary is basically over.
Reminder that Caucuses and First are different issues  Switch to a primary Schedule it first Confront the bully of New Hampshire, Bill Gardner.
Bernie Sanders will probably win the Iowa Caucus, but Amy Klobuchar will surprise many with a top three finish  Also, I'm not sure if Joe Biden will finish in the top 3, setting up a dramatic and crucial New Hampshire primary.

The Iowa-New Hampshire primaries are relatively recent phenomenons- take a look at elections in the 60s, 70s- Robert Kennedy got in very late (by today’s standards) Many candidates didn’t run on IA, NH then It’s a much less “linear” primary process, so there’s no data to follow.

I am way off base on this primary I can't figure out the voters, would you said about Bernie maybe true but he's in first place in Iowa and New Hampshire, I don't get the mayor Pete thing, I don't understand what Biden is doing, don't know why Warren hasn't taken off more,.

Objectively the funniest outcome in Iowa would be Amy Klobuchar somehow winning She wouldn’t be able to win any other state besides Minnesota, we would learn nothing, and the primary process would basically do a hard reboot in New Hampshire It would own and make this site good.

Yeah, sure, we’ll just keep running the same playbook that’s been losing for 40 years  Black voters specifically will come to Sanders in the primary Just watch Their big issue is electability and once Sanders beats Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire they’ll come to Sanders.
She isn’t at the 15% margin in either of the first two states according to RCP Momentum is a necessary component of a primary and it’s a serious possibility that she could come out of Iowa and New Hampshire with no delegates.
Obviously teeny sample size, but also interesting to note that in the two primary cycles where the win was split, Iowa went before New Hampshire and also predicted the nominee.

I mean, he leads in the polling, the primary involves more than Just Iowa and New Hampshire What's your criteria for being a frontrunner?.
Honestly, I'm over the whole primary process How about every state holds presidential primaries on the same day?? It would save billions of dollars and no states would narrow the field for others Why should the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire matter more than others?.

I hate this system where states like Iowa and New Hampshire get to handicap our primaries Who the hell are Iowa and New Hampshire to the rest of America? No offense, but they're both ultra white, and not at all representative We need one big national primary Enough already.
Iowa and New Hampshire, two states widely seen as setting the tone for the presidential primary, have one major thing in common: They’re extremely white   http://bitly/31kjnZO  #IowaCaucusespictwittercom/2ZrPOVub92.
I am also against unrepresentative states like Iowa and New Hampshire having such outsize influence on the national Democratic primary It's simply WRONG, @TomPerez.
Watching the Iowa caucus I was amazed at the size of the African American populationoh waitthat's a reporter  Why the fck is Iowa the first state followed by slightly off white New Hampshire in the primary season.
The thing I find fascinating every four years is how everyone collectively forgets that no one cares about the Iowa caucus results the second New Hampshire runs its primary.
Let’s say Sanders wins in Iowa tonight And he wins New Hampshire No one wins the Democratic primary without winning the black vote He doesn’t have a strong relationship with the black community so unless something changes he’s still unlikely to win overall.

It's a barometer Early momentum can swing polls Those who do well in Iowa and New Hampshire are likely to do well on Super Tuesday If a candidate does poorly in an earlier primary their supporters are less likely to show up at the polls in the later ones.

What’s the best argument against a national presidential primary? I’m all for tradition, but I can’t get over the outsized influence that Iowa and New Hampshire have on the nominating process This is particularly true for Democrats, who represent a racially diverse coalition.
It is way past time to take away the primacy of New Hampshire primary, which is the indirect reason that Iowa's non-primary has gotten the absurdly outsized attention it started receiving since Carter won it.
The March 3 primary is coming hot and fast Millions of CA ballots are being mailed out today Paul Mitchell eyes the  timeline and impact of the four early contests -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina https://capitolweeklynet/the-march-primary-is-coming-hot-and-fast/ … #caelections #elections #politicspictwittercom/1GyXTh3C2X.
True but what is also true is that no democratic president has never lost a primary after winning both Iowa and New Hampshire Bernie will easily win NH so if he gets Iowa tonight that's a slam dunk.

Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are bunched at the top in a poll of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire https://tribal/kvqw6wH .
Excellent Quick idea for you If you can get your self up to New Hampshire next week, big political event the NH primary is Tuesday You are only about 3 hours north if you drive DM if your interested and want details.
If Bernie does well it gives him a certain number of delegates, momentum going into New Hampshire and Nevada (next primary/caucus) and gives his campaign more legitimacy as it makes it harder for the media to ignore him Results should be out in the early hours of tomorrow x/3.
Just a quick reminder that all of this sound and fury over Iowa is about exactly 1% of the total Democratic delegates for this primary  New Hampshire is for half of that.

The first primary of 2020 is next Tuesday in New Hampshire; candidates will campaign across the state hoping to gain momentum ahead of the vote @newscentermainehttps://wwwnewscentermainecom/article/news/politics/national-politics/all-the-presidential-candidate-events-in-nh-ahead-of-the-primary/97-a5bd3e4a-0c17-4d1e-8f8b-9663bdb74584 ….
I think you're right  Caucus horsetrading will keep Iowa close, and Biden will grab momentum with New Hampshire next week  Biden is still leading in a majority of the primary polls.
What’s so dumb is Iowa Caucus exists only b/c Iowa wants to be first but the people of New Hampshire will burn down their own houses, barns & crops, then scatter the ashes in the Atlantic Ocean if they don’t have first primary They tolerate Iowa having a caucus & here we are.
With the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary approaching many Americans are making their choice, although there are those who are still struggling with who to vote for  #citizenry #democratic #educators #polarized #primaries #teach http://urbanpulsenet/as-democratic-primaries-near-educators-can-teach-hope-to-a-polarized-citizenry/ …pictwittercom/gDdKYf6ym8.
they scoured the country for the worst states to hold the first two primaries and came up with iowa and new hampshire just so I have to remember that they exist  imagine actively deciding to not do anything to change primary rules and therefore give all the power to albino cows.

Also you are in New Hampshire right? It must be pretty crazy there now with the primary only a week away.
BREAKING NEWS: Iowa and New Hampshire primaries have been moved to the END of the primary season, for fear of the DNC being unable to cheat or rig them right at this present moment.
I’m really not going to get too into this primary season until after New Hampshire.
Thrift stores all over Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada must be fucking goldmines every four years in the summer as the primary race winds down https://twittercom/daveweigel/status/1223744640223993856 ….
Parties do 2 preserve order & keep peace Every state wants to go first and enjoy the prestige & $ & attention This Competition is kept at bay by saying “Iowa is first ‘caucus’ and New Hampshire first ‘primary’ bc that’s the way it is That’s why Super Tuesday continues 2 grow.
Even if you question it in general elections, not having voter ID in the Iowa caucuses would be insane  Without it, there would be 3 bussed-in voters for every Iowan  Same for New Hampshire primary.
It’d be funny (no not funny) if the downturn in the economy was so severe and quick that it became an issue during the primary   “Sen sanders after your win in New Hampshire the stock market fell 4,000 do you wish to comment on that?”.
1) @ewarren campaign is offering free child care at a lot of caucus locations this year! 2) @iowademocrats tried to make more changes so the caucus would be more accessible, and New Hampshire lost its shit because it was "too like a primary" (Spoilers, it wasn't).
With Iowa running a popular vote, they’re essentially holding the first primary in America, and New Hampshire needs to respond by holding their primary RIGHT NOW https://twittercom/SeanTrende/status/1224363620978647041 ….
Not to mention Iowa is rigged with caucuses instead of being an actual primary which skews results in Bernie’s favor  Then we get 93% white New Hampshire Why do we need good politicians eliminated from the race because they can’t win in states that don’t represent the country?.
my prediction- #Yang will do way better than expected in the #IowaCaucus  and #Tulsi will do outstanding in the New Hampshire primary.
We need nationwide primaries (no more stupid caucuses), first primary by lottery Done with Iowa and New Hampshire being firsts.

Dem debate in New Hampshire Friday, NH primary Tuesday.
Not even mentioning that this pic is completely irrelevant since we're talking about superdelegates in New Hampshire, a primary state Are you dumb?.
Better idea - let the first primary be the five closest states in the nation in the previous election If we did it that way this year, it would be Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida The five states could theoretically change every cycle.
VoteVets, a PAC that endorsed Buttigieg, is making another ad buy in New Hampshire ahead of the primary there next week The initial buy is $650,000, according to a person familiar with it, and will begin running tomorrow  https://youtube/vor-bjx1GEs .
N Carolina is also a solid pick here, but I do wonder about the cash reqs to run in either of them  Either way—and I say this as an Iowan—the *insane semidemocratic at best morass that is a caucus* followed by New Hampshire is deeply suboptimal, esp if primary lasts a year https://twittercom/morninggloria/status/1224415385627193344 ….

“Campaign ’92: The Race To Avoid Being The Guy Who Loses To Bush” was an SNL in November of 1991 The drop from then to February was crazy Pat fricking Buchanan got 37% of the New Hampshire primary vote against the incumbent.

Here's a hypothetical for you:  Say it's 2056 and the governors of Iowa and New Hampshire are both running & will run away with the caucus/primary - making both states functionally irrelevant  What's the next contest that'd be considered decisive enough to be "first"?.
Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada go first in 2020 Here’s how South Carolina might factor those contests before the Feb 29 primary http://bitly/2uXsGmA .
If you complain a/b Iowa's caucus today, you MUST also complain a/b the fact that any attempt to make it any more democratic and like a primary is viciously fought by New Hampshire They literally have a state law that allows one man to move the election date to whenever he wants.

however, I think that Texas is a *terrible* suggestion as a first primary state Geographically massive, huge population Nobody can compete in Texas without a massive operation Retail politics in Iowa, and especially New Hampshire, are a crucial part of their appeal.
Happy caucus day Time for your periodic reminder that a fixed primary schedule is terrible The problem isn't that Iowa and New Hampshire are somehow unrepresentative It's that not state should have a monopoly on early results (and the influence that givens).
I remember the New Hampshire primary well but I can't remember much of the caucuses.

I like how the media still act as if Iowa & New Hampshire primary voters so far are in remote agreement with South Carolina & Nevada primary voters-- the better Biden does in the former two, the more some people will be sent home, they don't want Trump to have to face strong opp.

Iowa organization was an afterthought New Hampshire was much better—getting a primary team up and running was much easier than a caucus team In Nevada, it was so-so.
The only "value" in the Caucus is that since it's not called a primary New Hampshire lets Iowa go first What a system! https://twittercom/TonyFratto/status/1224340857437986817 ….

Today is the Iowa Caucus The New Hampshire primary is 8 days away I’ve been waiting so long for this.
So the caucus system is not very accessible and generally bad, but folks in Iowa don't want to go to a primary because then New Hampshire would jump ahead of them So: a proposal  Do it with ranked ballots and call it a virtual caucus.

And also Bernie is so insane in New Hampshire, that even if he got second (which is really the worst he could do in Iowa), it would be impossible given polling (and it’s a primary) for him to lose in NH.
The person who wins Iowa traditionally gets a 3-7% bump in the polls  It's the bandwagon effect The more you win the better you do  No candidate who has won Iowa and New Hampshire has ever lost the primary  Cali is in play early this year and is a game changer.
Nope Nobody getting 15%, no electoral votes passed out New Hampshire is the first DEM primary state.
It matters because of historic trends in primary elections   An Iowa win doesn't mean much by itself A New Hampshire win doesn't mean much by itself   But if you win both, every candidate who has won both contests back to back has gone on to win the nomination No exceptions.

In New Hampshire it’s just a primary so if for instance this poll ended up being completely accurate Bernie would take all delegates.
If Biden comes in second to Bernie in both Iowa and New Hampshire, I still think he’s in the strongest position going into the rest of the primary The only reason Bernie has a chance is that the first two states are so white.

But why play that hand in New Hampshire? It’s an open primary and the chances of Obama slowing him down there seems unlikely Whereas at least in Nevada him and reed can get the culinary union to not endorse Sanders, or he could pull that card in South Carolina.

New Hampshire has it written into the state constitution that it will always be the first primary, so to get there first Iowa holds a caucus (or Cluster***k) Otherwise NH would hold their primary like a week after the last election in order to be 1st.
FYI: the New Hampshire primary has a 15% viability threshold like Iowa, and in fact just about every state's primary does But it's just to convert raw votes to pledged delegates, and it's done at the state or district level So there's not as much potential for chaos.

That works in a caucus where there's a public vote, but what happens when it gets rigged in a primary like New Hampshire? The narrative that they're stealing the election is valid, so is the narrative that we need to vote But they're narratives fundamentally in conflict.

No, the truth is that New Hampshire bizarrely has a state law saying they get to be the first primary in the country so if Iowa becomes a primary they will automatically get leaped over by NH  Having a caucus is their own way around the law as NH made a deal with them years ago.

Also Iowa can only legally go first by remaining a caucus as New Hampshire somewhat inexplicabley has a law saying they get to be the first primary.

DNC needs to move Iowa and New Hampshire as the first states in the contest and put states like SC and NM as the first primary states More equal representation.
At this point we will be getting the results of the New Hampshire primary before the results of the Iowa caucuses.

So if the final Iowa count is not released before the New Hampshire primary that would make New Hampshire the first state to vote Are Iowans ok with this? A primary is way easier to rig and maybe this was planned all along Temporarily deny Sanders Iowa and give New Hampshire to.

Yeah, like, the DNC, Sanders, Clinton etc can "strongly suggest" all they want - unless New Hampshire stops requiring that they be the first primary state (which they won't) then Iowa will most likely stick to its guns on holding the first caucus so it can stay relevant.

Ex VP Joe Biden's votes were taken away by ex Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen Amy Klobuchar in  Iowa caucuses, it might be the same story in New Hampshire primary.
There is a reason Pete and the DNC are fighting to stop the SDE's going to Sanders  Declared winners of both Iowa and new Hampshire almost always win the primary Here's the kicker, you can only be declared winner if you win the SDE's  This matters a great deal, not popular vote.

It's clear now that the DNC's goal with all of this was to not acknowledge Bernie as the winner prior to the New Hampshire primary.
This is the only option that makes sense, the New Hampshire primary will be first next week.
Sanders has no power to determine if Iowa keeps its caucus Also: If Iowa drops the caucus it will have to hold it *after* New Hampshire, whose state constitution states it must hold its primary election a week before other states Holding a caucus first works around this.

Y'all think the New Hampshire primary is gonna be simpler than this but I wouldn't take it for granite.
New Hampshire State Law requires it to be first primary in the nation.
I think there should be 4 states on the same day Let Iowa and New Hampshire stay, along withSouth Carolina and maybe a western state like Nevada or Colorado or Oregon Get a blend and make it a primary in each state That’s my take FWIW.
Were Dems smart they'd pick a state with real juice to be 1st primary like Florida  It checks everybody's boxes for what they want in a 1st primary AND our delegates are not few  This small town, dare I say mostly white, system of inflating Iowa and New Hampshire is sooo 1800s https://twittercom/gaye_gallops/status/1224833582742503424 ….

I just don’t see any world in which Biden wins New Hampshire or Nevada at this point He’s still the favorite in South Carolina, but has any candidate ever won a primary after losing the first three states?.
For all intents and purposes, the Iowa Caucus should be moved to Maryland and the New Hampshire one should be scrapped in favour of having the South Carolina one to lead off the primary proceedings   Why? Much larger Black population than you'll find in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Buttigieg is going to plummet when racial diversity increases in primary states  This is why everyone cautioned people on reading too much into Iowa and New Hampshire.

Used to study American politics as part of my degree Contrary to news reports, the Iowa caucuses have never been decisive in choosing an candidate for either party The New Hampshire primary is far more important politically as helps to thin the field Candidates then drop out.
I sure hope so Here’s the deal, New Hampshire just became the first contest in the primary cycle to be a trusted result If the result  can’t be relied on without reservation and they don’t act swiftly to affect a change, no candidate will ever drop a million bucks there again.
I wonder if we get more clarity wrt any turnout surges from a simple primary like the upcoming New Hampshire.

Sanders may even come second behind Buttigieg in Iowa but even if he's third after Biden and Buttigieg, the senator will win the New Hampshire primary, just like he did in 2016 over Hillary Clinton  With Biden possibly losing the first two contests, he'll face a huge test 2/3.

Can't quite comprehend why humanity doesn't wish to abolish poverty here and now The choice is as clear as day   Perhaps that other 38% is where our rallies were at, and/or new hampshire primary is a whole different story.
If u think Iowa or New Hampshire are indicative  of what's gonna happen in the democratic primary u playing urselfthere's virtually no Black or Hispanic voters in either statetha fact that they go before more diverse states is ridiculous.
My tip: - Buttigieg & Sanders dominate in New Hampshire - Biden underwhelms in Nevada & South Carolina, establishment moves behind Buttigieg - Warren's inability to get 1st or 2nd place finish in the Feb primaries means she drops out - Leading us to a Buttigieg v Sanders primary.
It’s time to forget this rigged caucus and dominate the New Hampshire primary!.

I agree New Hampshire is an open primary state, so Republicans will cross over and vote for Bernie because he’s the easiest for Trump to beat.
I guess the silver lining here is that bernie’s best precincts still haven’t been reported, and biden completely bombed it while bernie is polling in an almost double digit lead in new hampshire (which will be the next state to have a primary).

I have no idea who is even going to win the primary at this point I’m feeling a contested convention.
New Hampshire tried to move their primary earlier and Iowa wasn't having it  The real answer to your question is steeped in history, envy, and racism.

New Hampshire will be very very interesting this year We can't really take anything from Iowa, not only because of this delay but because the mix of first and second preference votes doesn't let us see clearly who would win a primary, which most states are #IowaCaucas.

On February 11, New Hampshire voters will show which candidates are truly resonating with voters  Open primary  Same day registration  Paper ballots  Simple scanners  No coin tosses  No bullying  No persuasion  One private vote  One voice  #FITN #nhpolitics.
knowing the corruption of the Democratic Party, they’re probably gonna release the other 32% of the results the morning of the New Hampshire primary if Bernie’s the Iowa winner.

New Hampshire has a law, saying they have to be the first state to have a Presidential primary What would happen if another state enacted the same law? Would the logical contradiction cancel out both laws?.
So they send this fall guy out to take all the heat from the media, while they're literally cheating & probably changing vote results to help Joe Biden! The theory before this announcement was they would NOT release the results before the New Hampshire primary, to benefit Biden!.

The only problem is that New Hampshire law specifically states that it goes first If Texas had the exact same law, then there would be a feed back loop setting the first primary on January 1, 2023 for both states We could have something other than a primary and go first.
Please do NOT release any results from the Iowa caucuses unless you are prepared to release them in their entirety   What's the point if it's not the FINAL RESULT unless you're trying to influence the momentum into the New Hampshire primary & that would be shady af.

Now, the fact that there isn't a GOP primary could meaningfully boost Sanders' chances in New Hampshire, because a large number of independent voters could voter for him in the Democratic primary But that's different than "Operation Chaos"-type schemes.

The last time the DNC tried that with New Hampshire the SoS moved the primary into December and they relented Any party that did that unless it was both would also likely forfeit New Hampshire which is harmful for both parties.

but a lot of folks are saying this will move a lot of the attention usually given to Iowa to New Hampshire where he has a *commanding* lead (and is less likely to fuck up thanks to it just being a primary).
More than 20 percent of potential primary voters this year were either not old enough to vote in 2016 or resided somewhere other than New Hampshire These younger voters and recent migrants may change the outcome of the primary Read more: https://carseyunhedu/publication/snapshot/nh-primary-new-voters …pictwittercom/mWWSHZE1mn.

My favorite fact is that New Hampshire has written into state law, that they are the nation’s first “primary”  So, all we need is Iowa writing into state law “we go before New Hampshire”  https://enmwikipediaorg/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary#Significance …pictwittercom/8YTS04jwuD.
Except that if the opposing strategy was to deny momentum in New Hampshire, 7 days later, then its too late Its the same as GOP anti-voter laws Even if they are overturned, the damage of influencing the election can be done it still achieved its primary goal.

Who do you think will have their primary results first? Iowa or New Hampshire?.
Pete Buttigieg has left New Hampshire to raise money in New York, and will not return before the NH primary I believe his lack of presence will cost him a delegate  Updated NH primary prediction:  Bernie - 12 Warren - 8 Buttigieg - 4 All others - 0.

The Boston Globe Editorial Board, which traditionally endorses ahead of the New Hampshire primary, instead endorsed the end of NH being the first-in-the-nation primary all together - citing Iowa’s caucus confusion, coupled with NH's lack of diversity:  https://wwwbostonglobecom/2020/02/05/opinion/kill-tradition-nh-iowa-should-not-go-first/ ….

I think Bernie Sanders will win New Hampshire, Pete Buttigieg will get second place, and Elizabeth Warren will get third place #NHprimary.
Is Vegas laying odds on whether the New Hampshire primary results will be released before the Iowa caucus results are reported in full? At this point the smart $$ looks to be on NH.
We can hope, but it's not like New Hampshire isn't equally as non-representative of America as a whole (its diversity for instance), at least Nevada is third so we'll see what happens there It'll be the most telling of the primary overall Primary>caucus anytime though tbh.

Iowa can't have a primary New Hampshire is first Iowa must have a caucus so that New Hampshire is the first primary, unless the Democrats change the rules I don't think making Iowa the first primary was ever on the table I think it was other states they wanted to change.

If we don’t get the results before the New Hampshire primary, is Iowa really still “first in the nation”? Didn’t think about that, did you?.
I voted for Santorum in the 2012 New Hampshire primary I liked his economic message and his pro-life stance.
The caucus is out-dated Go to a primary vote like New Hampshire.
Bernie Sanders has really unified the entire media and powerful rich people world, left, right, center, into being scared shitless to the point where they're withholding his Iowa victory until probably the New Hampshire primary is over.
The Democratic Party is holding up the full results of the Iowa caucus to make it seem like Pete Buttigieg is winning there He is not, but since he is backed by the Clinton machine, they will bilk it as long as possible leading up to the New Hampshire primary.
 and New Hampshire knows hold to hold primary.

Iowa has a Caucus and New Hampshire has a Primary Both are immensely different processes where a caucus is privately run and a primary is run by the state or the government Therefore, there is *less* of a chance of any of this happening Key word less, cause it still could.
We have to do HUGE protests asking for the banning of the app and for the final results of the Iowa caucus before the New Hampshire caucus This is not normal If we do nothing else than complain, we will be screwed through all the primary process.
Which will be released first: the results of the Iowa caucuses, or the results of the New Hampshire primary?.

Do you think have the primary start with Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina on the same and first day of voting would help?.
Yeah I think it’s way too early to call, especially because Iowa heavily supported Pete in general He’s way behind in New Hampshire, and that’s a legitimate primary and not a circus Not like they won’t screw Bernie anyway but it’s too early to lose hope.
So have @iowademocrats released any timeline when we can expect to see the rest of the results, or are they just going to leave partial results and candidate claims in the air, through the New Hampshire primary?  Does everyone now agree they shouldn’t go first anymore?.

Iowa uses caucuses so that they can be in front of New Hampshire’s primary  And it’s Iowa because neither party felt like stopping them.
Every four years, this week, the one between the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary is the most exciting week in politics.
New Hampshire has a law saying they must be the 1st primary, Iowa jumps them because they Caucus.

Yes, because everyone knows New Hampshire definitely is one of the most deciding states in the primary race.
It appears that America will soon move on from Iowa with everyone knowing it was a complete mess This makes the New Hampshire primary that much more important A win for Bernie in NH will be significantly more helpful for Bernie than this mess of a “win” for Pete.

If the full Iowa results aren't released by noon Iowa time today, it needs to be nullified and the New Hampshire primary delayed in order to re-do Iowa in a democratic way with UN observers  Bernie should demand no less  This is getting outrageous.

I think the American people have a pretty good idea about  what Joe Biden & Hunter Biden were up to re: Ukraine -- Look at the IOWA primary results & New Hampshire.
No he's also leading New Hampshire He'd do pretty well in a primary actually.
Caucuses should go away and New Hampshire should go first In fact, New Hampshire has a state law that says they have to be the first primary.
I just couldn’t get enough political ads in South Carolina, so I thought I’d go to New Hampshire the weekend before their primary.

Poll: Buttigieg surges ahead of New Hampshire primary http://hillcm/NHFE7dF pictwittercom/9Dms953gFG.
I saw a poll where he's jumped to a virtual tie with Bernie in New Hampshire And given that no candidate has ever won both and not gone on to win the primary, they're probably hoping that will hold true.
