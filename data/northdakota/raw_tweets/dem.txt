“People aren't zombies who blindly follow what their chosen candidate tells them to do” If you vote for dementia Biden (you probably can’t name 2 policies you agree with him on, his record is awful) you’re doing it with your eyes closed 3rd party is the best option in Tennessee.

I feel sorry for Joe I wonder if he sees he's going downhill? I'm no Dem, but I just buried my mother after personally caring for her for many years Alzheimer's is an unmerciful disease--cruel beyond comprehension I have no doubt as to his dementia Poor, wicked old man.
