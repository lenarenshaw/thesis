Hey here's something to toss at those "he's not a democrat" peeps.
Unless you can point at, or sufficiently describe a supranational institution that is democratic, then your only choice as a democrat is to support the nation state This is very simple to grasp It's one example of relatively little nuance.

Well, you are a democrat.
Problem is that when Blair says none of "the major countries, with populations of more than 20 million" have social democrat majorities, he's missing that the GDP spend of many OECD states are to our left so they're more socialist than us even when they're "right".
Well democrats (not ALL, mostly just pandering politicians and their ill informed backers) do support legislations that encourage racial inequality (affirmative action), abortion, pedophilia (drag readings, children drag shows), etc I'm not Rep, but I'm def not Dem either.
The problem w/ the “he’s not a democrat” line is that it exacerbates America’s problem w/ labels and couples it w/ cancel culture - encouraging us to look at the surface and ignore substance while also saying “if you’re not overtly w/ us then you’re against us”.
Everything you say is true, except it’s no privilege to be a democrat.
