"Ok, who's ready for a Democrat president!?",colorado
Investigate @ICEgov??? #Bloomberg & his policies get ppl killed!,colorado
"Lol give me a fucking break. He is married to Reagan/Cheney counselor and hangs out with David Brock and Mary Pat Bonner. If any prospective Dem voter knew the absolute slime he kept company with for decades in one of the more cynical examples of party careerism, they'd pass",colorado
@AriMelber Your battering of Bloomberg's manager was the absolute most disappointing segment EVER by MSNBC.  I always had respect for you but it has been harshly tarnished. Treat people with respect and dignity.   Let them answer.  Everyone makes mistakes and everyone can change.,colorado
If it is so moot people like yourself wouldn't be whinging about it none stop. The caravans full of illegal aliens was a big problem until Trump fixed it. He made Mexico stop them. Do you forget the last three years and dealing with this monstrosity. I do. They even threw rocks..,colorado
Isn't New Hampshire democrat country?  BEAUTIFUL!!,colorado
So is Warren.,colorado
"Every time they show Iowa caucus footage set in a school gym, I get real anxiety about middle school Phys Ed",colorado
"Bernie and his supporters love, love, love the caucus system and fought to keep this undemocratic voting system in place.  Now that he may not win, you're not liking it so much.  Boo hoo.",colorado
"Is he not the Governor of Virginia? Also, the top Democrat in the state?",colorado
"Haven't done any calculations about the final alignment popular vote, but if I had to eyeball it I'd think Sanders has a large enough lead to maintain it. But it could be pretty close.",colorado
"The shipment of white pointed hats failed to arrive in time for the  SOTU. A Dem shipping company, no doubt.",colorado
Every candidate they have is terrible less guard and yang who are very bad but not terrible.  Trump takes the win slam dunk and $100 bet to any takers,colorado
Pity. Other than Gabbard she seems like the only normal dem running.,colorado
I hope Sanders implodes.,colorado
Yes I'm leaning towards a Bloomberg nom as well. He trolls Trump which is delightful to watch! Bloomberg knows how to handle Trump which also gives him a leg-up on all the other candidates. I want the one who can beat Dotard in November.,colorado
