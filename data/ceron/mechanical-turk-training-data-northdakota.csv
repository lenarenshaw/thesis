"2018 DEM won running on ACA not M4A in red to purple districts. A divided message from candidates & top of the DEM ticket will cost both. In 2018 Bernie avoided Virginia, Alabama, West Va, Missouri, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida & Georgia ?",northdakota
Or South Dakota.  Clickety Clack! #Biden,northdakota
"Or South Dakota. He tends to get States mixed up that seem to sound similar by name. Or... Maybe he had a secret meeting with his future running mate: Mitt Romney. Two losers, that couldn't even beat Obama. One joined him, the other's a double-agent-Democrat like John McCain was.",northdakota
"so like a white man to justify misogyny and racism in one tweet. Bloomberg and Trump are the same white rich men to all the rest of us. big white thinkers like you are why i stopped getting the Nation. Trump is normal in south dakota, come visit, they're a dime a dozen.",northdakota
"Fake facts Patrick. Per Forbes: A gauge of consistent, sustained growth is a 10-year window, beginning in 2007 before the recession and continuing until 2017. Over the past decade, the top states by GDP growth are: North Dakota, Texas, Nebraska. Your immoral prez-nota effect!",northdakota

"@BillClinton didn't win a single primary until Georgia (he lost the other contests held that day to Harkin, Brown, and Tsongas).   And then before that he had lost the first four contests (Iowa, New Hampshire, Maine, and South Dakota). @JoeBiden is still in the hunt. #Democrats",northdakota
"... & almost won Maine, (tied w/ Brown), which both are in New England; - Bob Kerrey was Nebraska senator who won South Dakota comfortably, a neighboring state; - Clinton came strong 2nd in New Hampshire, viable 3rd in Maine & South Dakota unlike Biden's decimation.",northdakota
"So why is Msss #Warren still in the race?   ""We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,"" Clinton told the editorial board of a South Dakota newspaper. "" I don't understand it,"" Clinton added, alluding to the calls for her to quit.",northdakota
"Intellectually, humbly, my Iowa/South Dakota farmer father could have given #Bloomberg quite an education.",northdakota
"By the way, Rudy's evidence goes much deeper than Biden.  Because his investigation was focused on corruption and election meddling.",northdakota

Republicans are afraid that they will vote Democrat.  RT @NaveedAJamali: Is there a logical reason why Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not states? If north and South Dakota can have representation why not DC and PR?,northdakota
