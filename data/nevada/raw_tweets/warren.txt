I like warren but I'm not sure this is right Bernie will end up giving all his policy jobs to the normal dem establishment while Warren has her own deep rolodex from academia and elsewhere to draw on.
love her & even though was a warren supporter until very recently, always fast-forwarded to her portions of the debates (still do) unfortunately her candidacy still feels like a long shot but i understand why ppl support her.

He’s The Godfather of those positions warren stole His ideas than went back on them once she got owned by Amy and Pete at a debate warren is completely self serving I say this is an ex supporter of hers.

Well they have similar policies but Bernie has heart and passion to this and the biggest movement of any candidate Bernie has had these ideas and goals all his life unlike warren.
I remember the time when we asked them to raise concern that Bernie is constantly misplaced in polls with warren, always with benefit to her.
