Yep I have seen a bunch of California voters saying today they’re switching their vote from Warren to Biden in the California primary just to try to beat Sanders such a bummer-she’s a much better candidate! (Than both of them).
The longer this primary is, the more I want a day time talkshow for Andrew Yang.

I remember that screen name as one of the ppl I had to mute years ago bc they went from posturing as a radlib to a full-throated establishment moderate the exact moment Bernie Sanders decided to run in the 2016 primary.
The Democrats’ first four contests include two caucuses, an open primary, and a semi-open primary (And the first two contests are in nearly all-white states) Hard to imagine a worse way to start the nominating process.

Lol, which is it? Is he or is he not a dem? And should he be allowed to run in a democratic primary?.
Not sure how someone can’t understand how having 6 figures of student debt doesn’t disincentivize people doing primary care in underprivileged medicaid/charity heavy communities.
The international community needs to pressure China to stop trade in wild animals, shark fins, bear gall bladders, tiger bones, rhino horns are all primary used by China Millions of sharks are killed each yr just for their fins, unacceptable.

You missed the walk back: https://wwwcnncom/2017/11/05/politics/donna-brazile-primary-rigged/indexhtml …  Short summery: Brazile lied, and Warren jumped on the 'rigged' bandwagon without even thinking about it or trying to understand anything  They were both wrong, provably, and both walked back their comments  Wake up to reality.

Which Democratic party candidate can win the Texas primary and possibly carry the state in the General election #TexasPrimary.
Lisa, I REALLY wish Democrats would SEE this! It's one thing for us Dems to thoughtfully vet pros/cons of OUR primary candidates But Trump's trying to grab OUR primaries by the p & Democrats should NOT enable him by giving his disingenuous "input" ANY amplification!!.
If you think this primary is bad you should take a look at 2000 Rep and 2008 Dem.
My polling place has free cookies They had more than eight packages in the garbage, not bad turnout for Supreme Court primary and mayor's race primary.
That's because winning the GOP primary is now quite the prize  Alabama Senator Doug Jones is TOAST this November TOAST  So whoever wins the GOP primary is going to be Jonesy's de-facto replacement.
I mean me too Blue or bust BUT it can’t be him No way I wish he would have kept doing what he did in 2018 and just invested in getting women and Dems elected without running here’s hoping someone strong surges before our primary.
What conscious choice? I’ve already voted against Bloomberg in the primary I’m just not going to vote for trump in November You’ve turned that into an excuse to berate me for racism several times  And you still sound like you’re trying to convince me to vote trump in November.
Those who miss the early voting window will only be able to participate in the primary on March 3, election day http://bitly/2T8nbdh .

Friendly reminder: Biden has NEVER won a state in a primary or caucus in the 30+ years he’s been running for President (1988, 2008, 2020)  But he’s the electable candidate?.
But Democrats are required to pay dues and support down ballot races He doesn't do any of that In fact, his group is trying primary form the left elected representatives the y feel aren't progressive enough.

Warren will always take the most convenient road for herself no matter how much it affects others whether it's letting a school claim her as their 1st WOC or saying the DNC rigged a primary against Bernie or flip-flopping on taking PAC money  When people show you who they are.
If EMF is smart they'll make Paxton the primary again, unless that is no longer an option.
I was quite pleased by the debate last night Of course, everyone lost their minds over it Personally, it clarified some things for me before the primary here in April.
@gromerjeffers is on the ground in Nevada ahead of the caucuses and he has this look at @BernieSanders's shifting role in the primary http://bitly/2T1EhsX .
Sorry, Dean, but I can't agree These primary debates help us distinguish between the Democratic candidates I'd rather learn about their differences than listen to them target Trump The general election is the time for them to join together for a full-frontal assault.
I'm for Warren in the primary That's where I can vote my choice, but in November, it's whoever the Democrat nominee is.
ah yes because republican primary debates have a commanding viewership at 7%.
It's not a change of mind, it's just dishonest She'd already funnelled millions of big donor $ from her senate campaign in to jumpstart her primary run, and took money from several billionaires.
I'm going to make this very polite and clear  Censorship is evil and what you are suggesting is colonizing one of Japan's primary exports that has more reach in other countries than it does in the US Case in point the rest of Southeast Asia.

I try hard to make my iPad Pro a primary work device, but I can’t figure it out I keep going back to my laptop It would be amazing not to lug the laptop around constantly.
I was thinking about that, and I would say yes  The only issue here really is which approach is "primary" and which is considered a sensitivity analysis.
Bernie won the democratic primary in WI in 2016, then Trump only won the general in WI by a thin margin Getting out the young and minority vote will make a difference We just recently a replaced a Republican governor Farmers are going broke, and our metro areas are very blue.
you're running in the wrong primary.
Immigration wasn’t the primary concern, though it would be foolish not to claim it was a major factor  Free movement and a new security partnership in accordance to the new rules The EU wasn’t the issue, it was which side would properly implement these changes.
I’m supporting them both publicly and have not yet decided who I’ll vote for in the primary (it depends on what the race looks like at that point and which of the two has the best shot at winning Cali).
Fuck it I'm for @ewarren  I don't care if the primary will already be decided by the time it gets to PA SHE'S GOT MY VOTE pictwittercom/ImpNXy3IF7.
I wish that people who constantly say “Vote blue no matter who!!!!” would recognize that they are discouraging people from critically engaging with primary candidates, discouraging political activism, and refusing to allow themselves to think critically or have standards at all.
That's deceivingly low Models dismiss him because he doesn't do well in nat polls, & cuz he missed filing deadlines for early primary states, so he is literally starting behind the others He polls extremely well in Super Tues states (where he's been spending), will get momentum.
Didn't something like 70% of the voters do early voting, which is like a primary? That's pretty all they need to know The voters have spoken Ditch the stupid caucuses.
They only polled Democrats It’s an open-primary state and the republicans have cancelled their primary so that they can vote for Sanders.
That was so absurd Once this primary is decided, I am done with MSNBC.
It’s probably true This is how Russia works; through planting seeds of doubt, encouraging tribalism, splitting the vote We just have to keep this primary from getting too personal so that there are no hard feelings when it comes time to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020.

Much higher than that 62% of the unaffiliated voting so far asked for the NC Democratic primary ballot so that’s an additional 45,000 voters in the Democratic primary.
Drag acts in primary schools are not gay role models Stop talking pish.
Honestly comparing candidate's records in a primary is not an attack.
But polls sampling thousands vs primary/gen vote counts sampling millions  (Maybe I need to find a way to go back and take a stats class, that would explain both polling methodology as well as academic research since I'd like to know some o' that too).
Republicans should all vote for Bernie Sanders in the Democrat open primary because if he wins we will win all down ballots and take back the house We need to destroy them while we have the opportunity Once he wins he will be our communist opponent pictwittercom/2lCsxlRfDk.

why can republicans vote in a democrat primary  in sc for bs.
Sure but if it works in the primary, it’s gonna be the only thing the GOP will lob If it doesn’t work and these centrists throw it at him and it means nothing, then momentum carries us forward to the convention And I rejoined the Democratic Party today, too.

You’re right, I’m not afraid, these children think that if you yell and wag your finger, things will magically happen 50 votes, maybe 60 are required to pass anything in the senate The primary season is almost over, so they’d have to wait until 2022 to unseat any Dems.

democrats literally turned out in the gop primary and voted for trump because they thought he would lose the general to HRC  so, uh, oops.
Does Biden win by a lot? 20% or more? A little? Or does Bernie pull a surprise upset and get close or win? Polls close in 2 minutes #scprimary2020.
Flipping between college basketball and the SC Primary results not a bad Saturday evening! #SCprimary2020 #UGA.
MSM seems preoccupied with race in the South Carolina primary Didn’t hear that much about race before or after the New Hampshire primary Maybe it says something about which candidate they favor.
6+6=12 The percentage of Republicans voting in the open Democratic primary I doubt those numbers are coincidental.
A huge impediment to Sanders’ 2016 campaign was the unanimous narrative that Clinton would win the primary and the general That influenced a lot of votes, and with Sanders now the frontrunner (by a lot!) and best positioned to beat Trump it’s an entirely different situation.

This is a classic example of misinterpreting statistics Comparing republican votes to democrats’ in a primary, when the republican president is the incumbent and has no primary opposition leads to no useful conclusions.
Ah yes the intellect of the left Can't present any useful ideas so they revert to their primary school days and use curse words Hope your education wasn't too expensive, I'd ask for my money back.
Either would draw such a huge contrast to trump which is what we need I’d prefer Castro but I can see an agreement why Harris would be a good strategic choice if it was announced before the primary is over.
Rep James Clyburn, whose late endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden could end up making a huge difference in the South Carolina primary, says that if Biden wins, then the candidate has to retool his campaign moving forward: https://wburfm/2wm1UET .

The tree planted by the MSM in 2016 bears fruit If anybody but the preferred candidate wins - in the primary or the general election - the reflexive and hysterical reaction will be the Russians did it, and there will be even less need for actual evidence than before.
The whole Dem primary field is about out of time to use it if they want to stop him from being the nominee If none of them have the goods I'm very skeptical that anyone does.
As an example, during the 1918-19 Spanish Influenza, border closures protected a few farming villages but the primary spreaders of the disease (troops returning from WW1) easily crossed through 100 yrs on with #COVID19, many lessons still haven't been learnt 2/3.

You have the results of the NV and SC primaries coming in before the NC primary on the 3rd Why wouldn't you wait until those are done in case something dramatically changes; like the candidate you voted for drops out.
I visit my primary provider's website because her up-to-date availability is listed and she uses an online booking app so I can schedule a time/date/duration at my convenience  She also has seasonal "packages" that include a fun activity, and these change from time to time.
So you have zero curiosity as to the timing of the story? If the post also withheld the story until a day before the primary, that’s not interesting to you.

Well for one the plan to cut primary care makes no sense to save money Their estimated cost savings is a small 200mil And all of it is short term When you cut primary care you increase the cost to the healthcare system because ER visits and hospital admissions go up.
I learned that it's more about them wanting him to win the primary, bc they think Trump will "easily" win against him in Nov It's disgusting.
Let’s be honest none of work out for health as the primary motivation.
If they wanted to negatively impact Sanders, they would have released the story before the debate so moderators could ask him about it while the largest audience in debate history watched  This is primary season It was bound to drop at an inopportune time regardless of when.
No party preference California sends out voter info to all registered voters so even those who automatically registered as NPP have multiple chances to request a Democratic party ballot if they wish; NPPs cannot vote for the Green Party or Republican party in the primary.

I hope so!  He got my vote in the Maine primary    Experts like @CookPolitical don’t see a realistic path for Bernie now  He’s done himself in in Florida with pro-Castro comments, for example.
absolutely yes if we don’t i’ll cry ????? also did u know that the risca primary lot did not experience wacky warehouse.
I really paid minimal attention to folks until about a month ago so I could vote in the primary and I’ll be going back into hiding until November because I’m going to do what I have to do come then This election season isn’t about to steal my peace this time.

I don’t think it’s “justified” and I don’t agree with them being pissed, but i see why they are pissed 2016 was a 1 on 1 in the primary, 2020 had 3, two of which represented the progressives and split the vote bernie bros are pissed she hasn’t endorsed him yet and it’s just fuel.
Yeah that was a hit for her in the primary Might be a benefit in the general, though.
Thanks for the civil conversation I’m sure it’ll be a bloody election I’ll GOTV for whoever’s the Dem nom, but in the primary I’m still weighing the pros & cons of 2 men I don’t see as our best options Their VP picks may tip the scales one way or another for me Goodnight.
Fortunately these recent primary beatdowns are a direct payback to Bernie nuts’ behavior in 2016  There is a somewhat satisfying justice in that.
In the primary, yes.
rather than indulge in third party identity politics, try to primary a crappy state or local democrat every little bit helps!.

would make sense to balance the primary calendar based on margin of victory from the last contest the slimmer the margin, the earlier in the lineup; at least so long as the electoral college exists back end can be loaded up with sure bets and never-gonna-wins.
Yep, Morning Joe was one of the most anti-Hillary shows on the MSM throughout the primary/general.
Because it’s the Dem primary The DNC is literally a private organization that helps elect Democrats I think the whole it was rigged thing is ridiculous though More than 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary in the primary.
I would have loved to see Bernie in the 2016 primary I dug his message then, I dig it now I'm still surprised at the "his followers are fanatical trash people" stigma  This is an effort to bring to light the "how can it be happening if I saw none of that" #algorithm.
My first choice as well I mourn for the primary where Harris, Warren, Booker, and Castro are the last ones standing at this point.
the fact that oregon is going to make me register as a dem so i can support bernie in our primary is killllling meeeee.
Trump pretty much took moderate R and moderate D policies, and mashed them together with populist flare  Sanders is straight up communist far left  No chance in the general election, but scary he gets so much support in the primary.
Going to be one of the things I get great enjoyment from this year when it’s a contested primary and the superdelegates don’t give him the nomination.
It’s a very unfortunate situation Democratic primary voters have chosen to place us all in Vote hard left or get Trump: them’s the breaks.
Pretty sure Sanders winning one caucus and his hometown primary doesn’t mean he has won the nomination   Slow your roll, mothafuckahs.
It was genius of CNN to hire @AndrewYang   I was very disappointed that more people didn’t see the #YangGang light soon enough, but I’m tuning into CNN for the first time in years to hear his insights into this cray democratic primary, and that’s some comfort.
ASAP!! the primary is next saturday.
Yes! God yes! I want Trump gone, & I’m terrified of the Reps removing presidential term limits if he gets re-elected He’s thisclose to being a dictator already  I’m not voting for Bernie in the primary though, not now I’m in a Super Tues state so I’ll (1/2).
The one time where he stood up and showed some courage was when he publicly stated he would not allow Trump to illegally divert congressionally authorized money to his stupid border wall He gets threatened with a primary and he caves like a coward on the Senate floor !!!.
No insults from me pal, just lolling at your primary school teaching you your elbows are your shoulders.
To clarify- in normal elections all political buttons/stickers/tshirts must not be visible in the poll  That rule doesn’t apply in Nevada today bc they don’t do typical voting as their primary They do caucuses which are WAY different & actually encourage participants to campaign.
No Joe  It is this caucus fiasco  One person, one vote Can we do a primary like normal people?.
Right, so the Trump/Putin supporters could switch parties and Vote in the DEM primary for Bernie  That is the plan GET BERNIE THE NOMINATION and then beat him in November  Wake Up people You need to vote BIDEN while we still have a Democracy left to fight for.
and none of your "screenshot or clip of Pete claiming he's the legitimate heir candidate because he can't win elections" make it reasonable for the media to ignore the campaign that has won, through single donations against pete's corporate backing, every caucus/ primary so far.
I can only hope that after Bernie wins another primary, the stress becomes too much for Chris Matthews' shriveled little heart and he croaks on live TV.

Hell, the sole reason we disagree on some aspects of the Democratic primary is that the Democratic primary exists   Have a single ballot RCV system (ideally STV) that allows people to vote their conscience *and* ensures any elected candidate will have majority support.

Which is exactly why the media would have given Biden 100% of the coverage as he attacked the Trump crime family, especially Jr and Kushner Every time Hunter was mentioned, Jr should have been exposed Trump gave Biden the opportunity to both win the primary and beat him.
Joe Biden has never won a Democratic presidential primary.
only one candidate has won the popular vote in all three initial primaries for either partyguessing its time to argue about who is the unity candidate in this primary again.

How many votes are you getting in the NV @GOP primary?  Oh yeah, they protected you by cancelling it.

I love how you think Bernie will win Hahaha oh wow, that is rich  I really do hope he wins the primary  He is the easiest one to beat!  .
If Democratic primary voters allow bros to bully them into nominating Bernie with threats that they won’t support anyone else as the nominee Trump is going to win re-election with a larger margin of victory in the electoral college than 2016.

So they rig it by having no Republican Caucus, simply declaring Trump/Putin the winnerand yet, Republicans can vote in a Democratic Caucus? Crooked people  Our primary vote is closed in Florida You can only vote for the Party to which you are registered.
Does not count if it was in primary .
Observation: candidate who is NOT a member of the party in which they're running for the party nom sure creates paranoia & conclusion jumping by their supporters over every little thing in the primary process Join the party for a say in the process instead of being suspicious.
Hey @SteveKornacki @andersoncooper tell the Dems! More people voting for anyone BUT Sanders in your primary! @amyklobuchar out @PeteButtigieg  out @SenWarren  out @TomSteyer out @TulsiGabbard  is a Russian buddy out or Trump wins @maddow @CNNSotu @MSNBC tell them PLEASE !!!.
Bern's supporters need to read How to Win Friends and Influence People or something They seem incapable - or not interested - of understanding that after the primary we need to unify under more than "Never Trump".
Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner of the Democratic primary, he's a Communist that wants to decriminalize illegal border crossing  He also wants to absolutely destroy the energy industry and booming economy over a hoax Climate change.

I think Biden will do better at Super Tuesday There’s a lot of love for him here I’m convinced republicans who are undeclared, are declaring dem for caucuses and for states like mine where you can declare at early voting - and then messing with our primary.
not only russia however Trump said in a rally for republicans to vote for bernie in primary.
Try to ignore the shit flying around and stick to issues  In the primary, vote for whoever best reflects your values and priorities for the next 8 years (my #1 is climate change)  Then in the general vote for the Democratic nominee  If we all do that, Trump will be gone pictwittercom/2256PUmv8n.
The donors who she didn’t ask to stretch their money on a campaign without a path will appreciate and remember this in the future She showed mature long term judgment that few in this primary have.
Do you think perhaps *some* of Bernie’s primary support is coming from Republicans who will end up voting for Trump in the general? It’s not like they make you show a Dem membership card when you go to caucus .

So I'm gonna unfollow Bernie and move on @ewarren  gets my vote in NY primary Was on the fence until this week No longer.
there are four kinds of people in the dem primary  people who have bernie as a first choice, people who have bernie as a second choice, people who don't care and will vote for anyone in the general, and dumbasses who think people will consolidate around a centrist.
Bernie never fully supported the Democratic Party Voted against immigration reform several times; wanted to primary Obama, pushed for investigation of Hillary’s emails Bernie only wants to use the Democratic Party to get elected!

For comparison, Klobuchar has been primary sponsor of 34 enacted bills, Biden 42, and Warren 9.
I voted for Bernie in the primary in 2016 and donated repeatedly I left because 1) Warren is better suited for the job, and 2) the behavior of far too many Bernie supporters turned me off and I don't feel he did enough to dissuade them   The reputation is earned.

Berners said they don't need my vote but welcome the GOP that's only voting for Sanders in the primary Haha, wait til November and it turns.
What Bernie did in VT in 1990 or 2006 is irrelevant to 2020 national election The amount he gets above Trump is smaller than the poll’s margin of error Hillary polled better & look what happened to her  States Bernie won in 2016 primaryare irrelevant in a general election.
No most votes where early VBM They where in ready to be counted before MSM came out with the news he knew a month ago he was getting bot & troll help We really need to clean up primary voting This is the 3rd klusterfuk Whatever happens I'm voting for the nominee .

No more cries of rigged primary if there’s oversight.
I actually voted for Ted in the primary He would make a fine president.
I voted in my primary todayfor what it’s worth.
The idea that we don’t care who wins the primary but will still turn out at Obama rate in general makes no sense.
I always hated Warren ever since 2016 betrayal, but never in my life would I have guessed she would be my most loathed candidate at the end of the 2020 primary, below even Klobuchar (republican joke) and Biden (literal republican)  She rivals Bloomberg, who is a literal monster.
I will not vote for Bernie in the primary, but I will vote for him, if he’s the nominee No other option, if we want Trump out.
Kristy and Joee are the primary leaders as of right now .
You can’t embarrassingly lose the first 3 primary states & still claim you’re the most electable candidate No shot at South Carolina after going 0/3 Time for @JoeBiden to drop out.
This guy has been in Congress as A Rep or Sen for 36 Years!!!!! And has been the primary sponsor of exactly 7 pieces of legislation that have been passed into law 2 of which were #PostOfficeRenaming.
Need to check those sudden democrat registrations Could be republicans voting for Sanders They are doing that in open primary states like South Carolina.
Disagree It's a primary, vigorous disagreement is good.
@swimmerbr78  Why does primary season at the end of the first term of a hideous presidency seem so bleak? It should be the opposite I will back anyone over Trump (or any R down ballot), but Bernie is DIVIDING our power AGAIN It seems selfish and egotistic to me  F*CK!.
I would like to see some rotation for who has first primary or either a quarter of states go first with good geographical representation And it is disgusting to see them invest so much in Iowa and NH for so few delegates just because they are first Many states are ignored.
It's not due to warren I think what you don't understand is that primaries are not a true democracy The Democratic primary goal is to gain a democratic candidate that is beneficial for the entire party You may want it to be the way you want it but it's not And you know what.
I mean, I did my part I voted for Hillary, even though I voted for Bernie in the primary Do I wish more supporters had voted for Hillary? Of course But I can’t blame them either Nobody has real numbers of who didn’t vote for Hillary that were for Bernie, unfortunately.
No, I don’t want Trump I’m a lifelong democrat I just don’t want Bernie, even though I voted for him in the 2016 primary He’s changed, but if he’s the nominee, I’ll vote for him because beating Trump is more important than any feelings I may have.
Why did a boy I haven’t spoken to since primary school like my bikini pic from 5 months ago at 3:00 this morning.
I've been watching less news lately And never on the weekends Reading has become a primary source It's the only thing that keeps me from that "circling the drain" feeling You are absolutely right The future has not been written yet.

You're right that unity is going to be VERY important for the general (and I think things look worse than they are during primary season) but I also believe that's a two edged sword there are people who are NeverBernie simply because of a vocal minority of his supporters.
Would you not want voters to decide this and leave your projections to AFTER the primary? It was also thought Clinton would beat Trump in 2016Correct? https://twittercom/BretBaier/status/1231345024631234560 ….

Yes, figures similar here But the regulatory body @NICEComms ignored both that fact, and the VAST amount of money wasted when desperately ill migraine pts go to A&E in crisis, having not received the right care in primary or secondary settings.
She doesn’t have my vote in the CA primary, but she’s get it in the general if she takes out Bernie and Bloomberg and secures the nomination.
Well, I hope this works out Sanders is leading in the Nevada Caucus   I realize we're still early in the primary season and things are likely to change after a couple more states hold their contest  It appears that Gabbard finished last  I vow to vote blue, no matter who.
I'm a white college educated retired man I had a 35 year management career in a Fortune 500 corporation   I'm voting for Warren in my state's primary  If Bernie wins the nomination, I'll vote for Bernie in November  But I hope it will be Elizabeth Warren https://twittercom/JRubinBlogger/status/1231364063726362625 ….

Lol Now you have some understanding of how we've been feeling, when Berners kept forcing us to do loyalty oaths  I did it before the primary, but when people would be dismissive and be like #VoteBlueNoMatterWho I began to refuse.
I will vote for Senator Warren in the primary  If she doesn’t get the nomination, I will be 100% behind the democratic nominee and do everything possible to get the blue vote out.
Amy Siskind wrote an entire article about it, how she not only voted against Obama in 2008 after Hillary suffered an embarrassing defeat in the primary, but was promoting that everyone vote republican in 2012 to stop Obama from getting a second term.
Bernie was gg to primary Obama bc he & Biden wr gg to put Soc Sec & Medicare cuts on the table! But BO won like he did - & I voted 4 him - bc he sold his hope & chg message very well & the US was ready 4 a blk prez! Unfortunately, we wr duped Hope & chg was really nope & can’t!.

Warren is in 4th place in her own party primary and you believe she can beat Trump Okay.
You've just described pretty much all primary politics   Yes, I'd rather we had a more civil debate (or, ideally, a nationwide RCV that bypasses FPTP primary politics entirely), but this isn't a situation that's unique to Bernie.
I’ve already voted in my primary so I no longer have any skin in the game Whoever wins the Dem primary has my vote and support There is no other but to #VoteBlue2020.

Fuck no  And there was no way in HELL I would vote for him in the primary, though I am enjoying his media reps assault on Trump.
Thoughts on Nevada  1 Bernie will be the nom 2 The primary's not over Just with momentum, he will likely be nom However, all states until at least ST can still change things This isn't a plea to go vote; just saying that those contests matter even if we can predict things.
I never watch him and I’ve seen just far too much of him on the air this primary season   I make a point of waiting until he comes on the air after Ari and then I turn the tv off or change to another channel.
I love Bernie, but I think the electability concerns are more about being able to turn out the moderate vote Only the most enthusiastic go to primaries, and we know Bernie's supporters love him The large # who stay home on primary day but vote on election day is the concern.

bloomberg isnt running in this primary (i dont think he's running in any actually but i may be wrong).
For the first time we have 25 candidates If you add all the moderate votes together, they put number Bernie That means more people want someone else as the nominee This is far from over The  entire Democrat primary system needs an overhaul #VoteBlueNoMatterWho.
Bernie Sanders wins Nevada primary https://videofoxnewscom/v/6135047033001 .
well no, this article claims that this primary going on between many choices for so long is gonna end up hurting us bc it's taking so long to find the right candidate (which is silly)  nothing about Bernie being the best choice for him.
The homes may even be worse & primary site of infection.
I agree with much of what you write but I disagree Bernie will build a large and diverse coalition when you open up to the general election I think he has a ceiling and it's 45% of the Democratic primary No bueno re trump I hope you're right about Bernie tho, he's the nominee.
For real miss being stress free like in primary school.
Five women cand were in the race when a herd of men stampeded in like each one is the dem lord & savior(I lost count after 18) & we have the mess  we're in now Same mess that let trump win the rep primary nom with a small % vote We lost Kamala and look whats left Sickening.
Fair point I am just saying there is decent reason to continue to believe that the moderates are facing a coordination problem Which, admittedly, may continue but that is the primary problem.
That's easy Vote for who you want in the primary and then vote for the Dem candidate who challenges Trump Obvious?.
@SirDimetrious Watched your vid on buffing primary weapons - just wanna throw this out there that we only have a patch preview and it's entirely possible @Bungie buffs certain primaries in the new season Regardless I agree with you - primaries *deserve* a buff  Also @MTashed.
It's not a realistic ticket though? So let's say Warren won the primary and she picks Bernie as her VP Would you vote for that I certainly would.
Nopenational primary ON THE SAME DAY! I am sick to damn death of fucking Iowa thinking they actually matter And don’t get me started on that “caucus” ridiculousness I know let’s all play musical chairs & the last one sitting picks who the ENTIRE fucking state will support.

Yes Now is 27 delegates for Bernie and 9 for Biden But we have to see the final results When I speak about American politics I love to watch and know statistics, County, all I need to know about a primary or a caucus This is my point of view.
Add getting the primary/caucus rules changed to favor him and the answer is yes.

Is Nevada an open caucus? I see rethugs voting for BS to mess with the primary nominee Everyone knows Trump wants BS Are rethugs voting for BS to inflate his totals??? Just asking.
It is becoming more obvious that the order of the states in the primary creates part of the problem  If South Carolina had been first, before Iowa, or Wisconsin or Michigan were first, then the whole dynamic would be different.
We have only just had the 3rd State primary The MSM may be pushing Bernie as the front runner but we are at the BEGINNING of choosing Until the Candidate is announced at the Dam Convention do not buy into this bs narrative.

Oh stop the divisive BS, please!! You won because everyone was caught off guard, thinking the primary was in Sep when the state-wide primary was Few people knew there was a primary in June That's why barely 10% voted You "won" with about 6% of the vote of registered Democrats.

I hate the way this is going, but not as much as I hate trump   The primary is about preference, but the general is about the soul of our nation   I’m discouraged, too, but trying to save my fight for the Big Picture Confusion, distraction, hopeless, division- all of these are.
If the goal is to break up the US and destabilize West, push Bernie in primary, then interfere in the general to have Bernie WIN barely in a close election, then push Trump to claim fraud and refuse to go Whatever outcome chaos and violence ensured which is the goal.

#BernieWinsNevada because you idiots didn’t attack the front runner Instead you attacked a guy all night who isn’t even on the ballot  Bernie will now sweep the rest of the primary because you’re all inept.
I’ll take primary results seriously when they are the results of statewide votes and not bizarro world caucus machinations that look like a hybrid game of Red Rover.
I will not vote for him in the primary, but I know he is far better than @realDonaldTrump and the rest of the corrupt @GOP If you were a patriotic #American and it was a choice between Bernie and Trump, you would vote for Bernie.

The MSNBC liberals can either claim Sanders is paranoid and no different than Trump since he complains about the media's treatment of him OR they can have on-air breakdowns after each primary or caucus, but they dont get to do both.
I think that will be his primary role in San Diego! .

Bernie is driving the most first time voters to the polls in a primary, he performs better nationally with independents He helped organize the blue wave in 2018, he's a safe bet for down ballot votes.
From the start, I mocked Klobuchar bc she felt so irrelevant & so cringe Warren just slimey  Longer primary went on, seeing how horrible @ewarren 's political instincts and charisma were, and actually hearing Klobuchar debate (especially last two), I realized I had it flipped.
Why can’t we decide which candidate goes to the primary by a friendly poker game.
"you are racist"  lol Nice dialogue you've got there  No candidate puts ADOS at the center of their campaign If that's what you're looking for, you won't find it in the Democratic primary Bernie is the best candidate in the race for black and brown Americans #Bernie2020.
Because most people don’t pay much attention to the primary till about the last two months and make their decisions as it gets closer That’s the theory I believe and explains why Biden lead for so long until he suddenly collapsed.
Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner of the Democratic primary, he's a Communist that wants to decriminalize illegal border crossing  He also wants to absolutely destroy the energy industry and booming economy over a hoax Climate change.
Don't get me started I work in a primary school and this is where the proposed cuts are to be made, forthcoming Education and Families sector is in for a turbulent time Caused solely by the mismanagement of devolved powers.
People keep overlooking that beating President Joffrey in popular vote isn't enough It is very likely going to come down to Wisconsin, and unfortunately El Naranjo is still beating Bernie there I voted for Bernie in the 2016 primary, but not this time.
Why have Democrats chosen to make #IllegalAliens their primary constituency?  Shouldn't the American President be concerned about American citizens first and foremost? pictwittercom/MPp5lL4ffa.
America, on the plus side we had a gay man win a primary, will probably have our 1st Jewish POTUS, and probably our first female veep.
I didn't think trump could win but here we are So I'm no good at predicting I just know Waren and Sanders are the two people who seem most concerned about people like me So I'm voting for one of them in the primary If the D's choose Bloomberg I'll just leave that box blank.

The Dem primary has had much more lasting consequences for Discourse, but the GOP primary was much better television Everyone forgets how boring the Dem debates were (after the first one, with Webb) because the real legacy of 2016 was to them fought on twitter.
Clyburn specifically said he would not endorse anyone before the SC primary.
I’m a WOC, he doesn’t speak to me I don’t see him as compassionate or thoughtful about my needs and concerns as a WOC   But someone does! And her name is @ewarren! Can’t wait to vote for her in the IL primary.
I'm sure that you'll then accept that title too if Bernie doesn't win the primary and your choice is Trump or the Democratic nominee I hope is such a case you're ready to cast that vote for the non-Bernie Democrat.
Can be that they take it as a kind of sub-category or smth but they primary focus on the goal itself And if youre fine with that, Id really like to focus my time on more useful things now than to repeat text messages over and over again.

Oh yeah, she's got tons of momentum coming out of that Nevada primary!!.
You're referencing shoot 'n loot types, huh? In that case, use the weapon with the most ammo/ easiest to obtain ammo as your primary The stronger weapon is for if you're quick loading too much against a boss and you're getting tired of trying to conserve ammo.
Woah that's crazy you can tell the future I wouldn't have thought that seeing as how Sanders performs best against Trump in all polls and is also winning the majority of the primary.
Please understand that only a very small percentage of primary delegates have been won/lost  The fact is that Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada are NOT going to decide the winner  Bernie is not winning the big delegate states  There is a lot still to be decided.

If 2-3 people drop out, he’s done  So, there’s that  He’s only ahead because the others are splitting the votes  Trump did the same thing in 2016  If the Republicans didn’t have 40 people running, Trump wouldn’t have won the primary.
Even if nothing passes The demand will be there The conversation will have begun He was quite effective in making this the main topic of the primary I think it’ll be just fine It’s not like Sanders is going to make any Trumpian moves while in office Or do favors to the rich.

If I remember correctly Clyburn had expressed concerns about Hillary and Bill both and decided not to intervene He had last endorsed Obama This endorsement for Biden is HUGE One of the most significant endorsements in this primary.
I'll vote Elizabeth in the primary - I'd love to have Klobuchar but I think @ewarren really is the best bet going forward from this point(please delete Bernie from everything).
Trump has revealed he is in the plot to rig the democratic primary for Bernie Sanders he's been instructed to take an easy on Sanders for the moment The plan is to install Sanders as nominee then when timing is right use Russia as leverage over Sanders to destroy him.

It would help if people dropped out so he wouldnt have to spend money on a protracted primary.
So the other 96% of us who have not even voted should give up because a few, small (and mostly white) states gave Sanders 30% of the vote? The primary system is broken.
I'm voting for @ewarren in the #Utah primary.
Two tracks:   Money going to take down McConnell is probably money that could be going to Maine, which is a mistake  Money going to Pelosi's primary opponent is probably not going to Cuellar's primary opponent, which I am a-ok with which ought to be a warning sign.
My future former Republican friend told me today that he’s going to officially change his voter registration to Democrat so that he can vote for @PeteButtigieg in his state’s upcoming primary.
@ewarren is my choice!! Excited to cast that vote in upcoming FL primary.
This is a Yougov poll dude They’ve been outliers for Warren for the entire primary cycle   She’s won a whopping zero delegates from the last two states now It’s over Stop taking money from these poor people.
How about same concept but set up as a fun daily competition among  Super Tuesday states, allowing  supporters from the 14 states to race to fill the grid from $1 to $304 (March 4) Full grids x 14 states = ~700k x 7 days b4 primary = 5 mil .

I always said he wasn’t my first choice, but I’d vote for him in the general election Turns out, I voted for him in my primary yesterday People need to get the concept of voting AGAINST trump, even in the nominee isn’t your first choice.
I’d say that a candidate winning 3-3 in 3 vastly different primary states (no repub or dem candidate has EVER in history done that!!) is PROOF in numbers showing unity behind a candidate So you can whine and obfuscate all you like but math doesn’t lie.
My whole family (four) is voting for Elizabeth Warren in the Georgia primary.

tbh that's one of the biggest rays of hope for bernies primary chances biden voters dont give a fuck about biden, they just want a "safe" choice as evidenced by his inability to pull votes from pete, klob, etc without them dropping any big hit to the momentum & "safety" is huge.
Just got a call from @BernieSanders campaign about the upcoming primary Guy on the phone did not seem to want to engage me at all when I said I was uncommitted following @ewarren - not that I wasn't going to vote, not that I'd decided against their guy, just undecided 1/3.

#NotMeUs is about coalition building, not pushing people out One thing my fellow Bernie supporters, myself included, need to work on if we want to turn this primary around is to win over hearts and minds Convert people, instead of dog piling them.
Also have every state do their primary at the same time My state hasn't gone yet but so many candidates have dropped out already The early states get too much power in deciding a whole party's candidate Fuuuuuuck that honestly.
Between Biden and Bernie- I’m thinking FL will go Biden in the primary.

Did they think she couldn’t win because they thought she would run an inferior campaign or because she thought others wouldn’t vote for her in the general due to her gender? The second case implies the primary voters aren’t sexist but believe voters in the general are.

This is one ill probs wait for reviews first cause i really needa see some proper gameplay first what even is the primary gameplay loop.
Genuine question too: What did Sanders say to Warren during the primary that was offensive? How did he treat her that makes you or others upset?.
And some of y’all don’t think he should have higher standards than Biden  I mean fuck I’ll vote for whoever to get Trump out too, but I’m not going to jump on a bandwagon during the primary.

Proud to announce that I won the dem primary.
Definitely one election won't settle it, but i at least want someone who will bother fighting for itone thing i wonder is if the swing suburban vote is overestimated vs people who will just vote for whoever the dem is, a group that's hard to judge per primary turnout.
Bernie would not even bring himself to say Black Lives Matter, follows through by not campaigning in Black hot spots during this primary, just not showing up; ghosting us If you lift poor white people, I AM still Black.

I don’t think anyone is disagreeing  That is why he is the front runner  But, the primary goal needs to be to beat Trump and the more support the better  Warren is a strong principled Democrat  She and her followers should be welcomed.
The problem is that most of the country did not vote yet I live in PA We do not vote until end of April I guess this primary process worked before but this year it seems that it eliminated really good candidates mainly because of the funds.

Early voting has its drawbacks, certainly I marked and returned my ballot on Feb 21 for the March 10 primary A *few* things have happened since then! But, I can track receipt of my ballot online It’s been received, but no counting until actual election date.
Better primary hygiene may be an outcome of #CoronaVirus OTOH, good luck getting kids not to touch faces, pick noses, rub eyes, etc.
Hi, my family members received biometric instruction letters for their PGP application today The primary applicant is in Canada, but the others are in China As VACs are closed in China, my families in China are not able to book any biometrics appointments, what should they do?.
the highlight of my day today was when my lunch table all wore primary colors without planning it.
The primary in Oregon isn't until May Doesn't that suck? I have to wait to rig!.
If we are going to outsource the nomination process to the public, it’s crazy to do it in a way so that half the states don’t get a choice My vote mattered in this primary and most of my friends will have no say in the matter.
I’m not a campaign manager, but skipping a rally 5 days before the primary just seems like a bad idea.
Hey guys maybe the toilet paper is sold out because Bernie won the primary in Utah and people realize there won't be toilet paper, or food, for much longer.
Ok, so the guy who has been attacked by the incumbent already without any apparent harm is less electable than the guy who seemingly couldn’t win due to the attacks of his primary opponents Cool.
Here's a very useful graphic going forward in this primary pictwittercom/ogrE162o4h.
@ewarren offered smart plans and ran circles around the last two men standing It was always baked in that it took an old white man to beat 45 which is sexist in itself I will be taking a political sabbatical from this primary Will just vote for whomever the Dem nominee in Nov.
@greatermcr funded our performance of Mr Shapeshifter at the excellent Britannia Bridge primary in Wigan yesterday What will you take away from the play we asked the children? ‘If something doesn’t feel right it isn’t’ and ‘never give up when you need help’ #CEASEpictwittercom/y4ojetVNPP.
Oh, Ilhan pushed to primary Warren And she went after Warren viciously  Warren even refused to shake Sanders’ hand after that was not light.

He’s running in the democratic primary, a member of democratic leadership, and would/will be a democratic president I seriously don’t understand that talking point.
Probably still will in the primary .

@ewarren As you consider making an endorsement in the coming days, please keep in mind that @RonJohnsonWI is at this hour preparing to drop a subpoena on Hunter Biden to dirty up Joe’s campaign Deja vu “but her emails” Please stop Trump in his tracks to meddle in our primary.
dawg Biden will lose spectacularly He's only doing well in the primary because the political establishment has his back it won't carry him through the general election just like it wasn't enough for Hillary There is only one person with the momentum to beat trump it's Bernie.
You of course, KNOW why @MikeBloomberg, the Republican is endorsing @JoeBiden, right? You know why the South went overwhelmingly for him, right?

This is one of the most important primary elections ever and we're going to allow another vote to be cast without a debate?   WTF!?!?!? There should most certainly be a debate before the next voting day #DemDebate2020 #DemocraticPrimary #DemocraticDebate #ThursdayThoughts.
The DFL primary is not an election, exactly Results go to the party, which decides what to do with the votes from candidates who dropped out  Amy was at 56% That seems wrong I think they gave a bunch of her votes and others who dropped out to Biden.
Early on in this primary I was antiBernie and didn't hear a peep (despite many Sanders supporters on my feed) but now that I am Sanders side and tweet about Biden I keep seeing randos in my replies.

The media is putting its thumb on the scale of this primary via this kind of terrible and sexist media coverage Be better It’s not that hard.
There are toxic surrogates of every single candidate, I mainly have issue with people who think that extreme bernie stans specifically on social media are the only folks being toxic for their candidate in this primary across all media.

You do understand that it's not going to matter who wins the Democratic primary right?.
I’m just gonna open random precinct maps in Photoshop and go wild with the paint bucket tool for the RTs  It’ll be time for the Illinois primary before anyone realizes what I’ve done.

Biden wiped the floor with Bernie among African Americans in South Carolina primary this year, are you kidding? They trust Biden more than Bernie  You’ll see same in Georgia and Alabama soon, too, and elsewhere in the South.
Donna brazille who leaked debate questions to Hillary in 2016 getting upset about people saying the DNC is trying to prevent bernie from winning the primary and telling him he should work with the establishment is the kind of thing that led to trump.
I voted! If your in a primary state today you should vote too! #SuperTuesday.
Yo if @BernieSanders wins the primary, we’re still going to push him on SESTA/FOSTA, right? Like that’s why we want someone like him in office, right?.
Both parties do that Haven’t you been following the Dem primary?.
Republicans who are going to vote for trump in the general are voting in the Democratic primary.
Exit polls under-count young voters, who tend to vote by mail  In California’s 2016 primary, 59% of the votes cast were by mail-in ballots In the 2018 primary, 68% were  Why do we keep suffering through the same hot takes every 2 years?.

I voted early in this primary, but I remember years ago, standing in line for 3 hours after work to vote in a presidential election & for an independent candidate who didn't have a snowball's chance of winning It was the principle of the thing We can vote We should vote.
i know a Nebraskan who is a Bloomberg supporter and thats why i fully support their primary being last.
Agreed on both  But, I saw someone say today that "The primary is about you, the general is about the nation" or something like that.

Even if you know that she cannot win and supporting her can only at this point help Biden lose to Trump? Its known I guess I put more value on my primary vote than that I get your point I just don’t find it pragmatic, especially if you support a progressive agenda We gotta win.
Also isn't the GOP primary a moot point?.

Absolutely! But if we get to the convention with, say, Biden having won the red states and Bernie the blue, shouldn't we go with the sure blue thing? and/or look at who wins WI, MI, PA, FL, OH in the primary and back them .
I hope I care enough about the next primary to remember I can go in a week early.

@joncoopertweets nothing but respect for you, but Biden is a very conservative Democrat We need a huge change in the establishment of this country, and Biden doesn't strike as one to change the status quo Regardless of who wins the primary though #votebluenomatterwho.
Not speaking about a candidates issues in a primary doesn’t mean republicans aren’t going to find out or already don’t know.
Hey, if you're a primary state, get out there and vote for Bernie Sanders already! What are y'all waiting for!? #SuperTuesday.

What did not work?   She had record win in number of votes against Sanders in primary and had more votes than any white man in history in general against trump  She had EC manipulate and stolen  Had she know this damn dirty fact 40,000 more votes she would be in the WH 1/2.
Since this is a primary for the Dem nomination, that would mean this indicates an uptick in Democrats in Utah, no?.

@LarrySabato one effect I haven't heard addressed in media coverage: where did GOP voters go on Super Tuesday, in the absence of a GOP primary? Would be good to know how many did *not* sit it out ie who voted in a Dem primary And whom did they favor? (Bloomberg, I suppose).
Listen, today is high stakes But today is not the end, win or lose There are more states to primary EVEN AFTER THAT there is a massive fight when this election is over We need to put pressure on those in power If we don't then they will ignore us and let us die.
I’ve been thinking about it a lot We’re a corona hot spot here in Seattle and our primary is next week I sure don’t want to go stand in a crowd to hear a candidate speak .
I mentioned her because she beat Bernie by a lot in the primary and if more people had gone out in support of him he would have beat her You get the candidate you want by getting people to vote and lifting your candidate up, not starting shit on the internet.

Yeah, we all need more tv LOL  I will be glued to it tonight watching primary results, though.
Why did you vote in the democrat primary?.
History says Hillary Clinton was such a bad candidate she had to cheat to win a primary against Sanders and then went on to lose to a Real Estate Fraud   Those are facts,  not opinions,  Hillary.
There's nothing which can be done for him It's a rare and very aggressive form of primary lung cancer Just 10 days ago, endoscopy showed small 'blockage' in his left lung and vet gave ABs - today scan showed huge mass in both lungs Vet says he has 2-3 weeks left at the most.
No matter what the results are tonight, I’ll always remember the moment when my dad told me he was voting for @BernieSanders in the Alabama primary .
I highly support vote by mail for everyone   I also get absentee ballots for disability  1 I need to go to the town clerk every year and fill out a form for absentee ballots 2 I didn't get my ballot for this primary   Both are true How this effects vote by mail It varies.
The line for the Dem primary is loooong, while no one is in line for the Rep primary .
I say leave her on and allow the other guests to remind her that she helped rig the 2016 primary for Hillary Show the tape! Please show the tape I want to see how she reacts to that.
God this primary is ridiculous Make it end.
Just cast my first dem primary ballot in southern Maine and was told that it is a very high turnout like 2008 IMO, this might be a good sign for Biden In Maine anyway.

That's not the pointComey indicated this is his FIRST vote in a Dem primary based upon the need for "a candidate who cares about all Americans & will restore decency, dignity to the office"Whether he was manipulated in 2016 or not, don't negate the man 4 being able 2 change.
Same in San Antonio  You choose your party’s primary  The election official gives you the blank form whic, once inserted in the voting machine, pulls up your party’s candidates  One machine for both party’s.
I don’t think Warren success would cause that much dramaat least not nearly as much as Buttigieg or Klobuchar might have Bloomberg will probably cause more drama, “win” or lose  Regardless, hope your primary voting goes smoothly.
of Dem primary voters You are lucky if you get to 25% of RVs.
You were really out of line today Ps, it's OBVIOUS the Democrats are rigging the primary like the last time.
Like when @MMFlint said SC is not representative of our country? I actually heard this from his own mouth in an interview right after the SC primary I was like "What the fuck he just say?!" Had to play it back And yep What I heard was "Black voters in SC don't rep our country".
Can we please primary and vote out every Democrat who has endorsed Bloomberg? Absolute shills.

Really dislike news outlets that make you subscribe to access primary coverage.
Talking to folks who early-voted for Buttigieg or Klobuchar is genuinely heartbreaking The party needs to figure out how to actually represent the will of the voters in the next primary season.
I realize that, but the way he went about it was not ideal My opinion's still the same - vote for your first choice in the primary (that's what it's for), consolidate around the winner in the general It's really not that hard.
You're retired and lecturing people who are working two and three hourly jobs without benefits for not being able to stand in line, potentially for hours, to vote in a primary for a party that actively loathes them and will do nothing to make their lives better.

Crazy that Americans have to stand in line for hours to vote on a primary Why do you guys put up with this shit?.
Those voting for Trump (or rather not socialism) really aren't going out  Trump's secure in the Republican primary  So guess who you're polling?.
The primary winner in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, Idaho, Wyoming, N Dakota, S Dakota should have delegates deducted.
I think you are not  telling the truth  if people don't like Sanders, why did he win all but 1 primary?  Please reconsider your statement Thank you.

Well online is small, first of all There’s like ~1000s of Bernie Bros, but it feels like more imo Second, primary participation generally is low I’d fall back to an argument that he’ll boost turnout in those groups in the *general* where turnout is always highest.
Planning to write-in Warren, even if she doesn't make it to the ballot in Oregon in May Ultimately, I'll vote #BlueNoMatterWho in November, so I'm using my vote how I damn well please in the primary.

Can’t vote in the primary until June now that I’m a DC resident, so I sincerely hope @ewarren is staying in the fight (see what I did there?) until everyone has an opportunity to vote #TeamWarren.
Five questions I'm asking tonight:  - Where do Buttigieg/Klobuchar voters, especially college-educated whites, go? - What role(s) will Warren and Bloomberg play? - How will Biden perform in non-Southern states? - Who wins Texas? - Who advances in the Alabama GOP Senate primary?.

Out of curiosity, a higher low would fit into your primary? I'm seeing a potential retest of the $2930 area overnight.
And you can deny the simple logic that what hurt Hillary prevented her from winning (she needed thousands of votes in a few states), and he hurt her most An actual democrat competitor in the primary (as opposed to a guy posing as a Dem, Bernie) wouldn’t have had that effect.
Hey, if you're a primary state, get out there and vote for Bernie Sanders already! What are y'all waiting for!?.
Exit polls in this primary are not a good place to test the favorability of socialism because Republicans are not going to show up big.
I’m low key hoping Bernie Sanders will win the presidential primary I have a feeling he will be the one beating Donald Trump in November #DemocraticPrimary.

I’m not a “Clintonite” actually, I voted Bernie in the 16 primary, and voted Clinton in the general election I’ve been criticizing Bill Clinton since the 90’s And the loss stings because we got Trump, not because I’m upset about Hillary.
Amys our so if you want a woman Warren is still in  This is the primary- I say everyone vote your heart and be content that you did your civic duty!.
Yep Joe loved Bernie in 2016 This year he loves Warren I even voted for Bernie in the primary in 2016 but his cult has turned me off so badly o will only vote for him if he wins The mom Which is unlikely Thankfully!.
NR ostentatiously published a magazine edition entitled "Against Trump"  Which, whatever, it was during the primary and I was a Cruz guy then any way  NR and NeverTrumpers problem is ego and arrogance I misjudged Trump same as them  Difference is I know how to admit error.
Guessing most anyone who has made it to a primary in the last 40 years knows how a vaccine works pictwittercom/ikvRuVrm9g.
And Bernie was able to pass a bipartisan Veteran's bill and the first ever War Power's Act to end an illegal foreign war Plus he's actually winning states in the primary  Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house.

Another long day But it was beautiful! And it’s primary day First time we’ve had 3 ballots go out.
Just voted in a Presidential election for the first timewatch for the @smod4real write in in the Tennessee (R) primary.
My 17 y/o was able to vote in the VA primary because he’ll be of age by the general election I’m pretty sure 3 different votes were cast by my household and that’s okay I’m thinking he voted for the one who took a moment to say hello and inspire him in 2012 pictwittercom/EdgAYWbjM2.
I'm political geeking out a bit The primary's been so long, with many ups and downs Who will challenge Trump and how will 2020 go have loomed for longer Today moves the story forward I have ideas about what I'd like to see happen But also I'm just curious to see what happens.
Voted for @JoeBiden in the California primary.
Categorizing different primary & secondary sex characteristics as being categories labelled "male" or "female" is & will always be transphobic It doesn't matter how much you try to separate it: calling trans men "biologically female" and trans women "biologically male" is wrong.
When do people start freaking about the primary results tonight? Surely close.
No such thing as “super delegates” in a “real” democracy Republicans select a primary candidate based on votes by American CITIZENS !.

So I see on my feed that some people are upset about who another person voted for in the democratic primary  There’s no need to be   I think that each of these candidates will uphold the law & restore integrity to the White House   Vote for who you like   Just vote   Vote.
Member of your party to even vote in a primary, so in those cases it’s public information anyways Basically your party is public information, but who you actually cast a ballot for is private.

I just voted early in IL, they did ask me to declare  I remember them doing that in the past too    They said something about it depended on how the person running registered  I don’t get how Trump is able to tell MAGAs how to vote for Bernie in primary.
I totally agree with you and also voted in my first Democratic primary   I've always been a registered Republican & finally changed to Democrat Need to bring some civility back to our government  #vote #DNC #Republicanparty #Vote2020 #congress #PoliticalParties #Senate.
It may be close to the 2016 primary but we’ll know for sure after the votes are counted.
Right That’s why I’m voting Bernie in the primary and hopefully for President   And if I have to, I’ll vote Biden in November.
Dems lost Wisconsin and Bernie will most likely do substantially worse than Hillary among everyone to the right of Dem primary voters, which is around 2/3 of voters Some will go Trump->Bernie but more would go Hillary->stay home, or Trump.

The DNC just called to request a donation from my husband He politely told them “not right now” while I yelled from the background to share my thoughts about them pressuring some candidates to drop out of the primary and support someone else.
And she should retract this and apologize for being an idiot @JoeBiden and @SenSanders should come out with a strong plea for unity now and say they will support the eventual nominee, and now let’s go out and have a spirited but respectful rest of the primary.

Shoving 'important messages' into games as a primary focus leads to shitty game??? Who knew  (goes for books, movies, TV, entertainment in general)  People are getting fed up with it, I hated it in 2000's it's just worse and worse.
one reason is because Corp Dems keep choosing the Dem before the people do in the Kentucky primary, like now for Amy,  Clintons yanked Ashley Judd for the other loser who ran last time  Let Kentucky choose on their own.
Biden knows his cognitive decline is so serious that he does very few events and wont even run for a second term We would have to go through this shit again The worst part is those clips are from around Super Tuesday, not the whole primary.

"whole premise" is maybe taking it a bit far but I concede you are correct that Biden got more votes in a higher turnout primary in VA He also got many of those votes at the very last minute after the Clyburn endorsement, in a split progressive ticket that doesn't exist anymore.
Do you know how freeing it is to make a decision and then just stop listening?  I don't have the vaguest idea what you're talking about and I'm as happy as I can be about that fact  May 5, 2020 I will cast a vote for Joe Biden in the IN primary and will work to get him elected.

❝ Hey, let's not get it twisted I appreciate you guys havin' my back more than anything It's the primary reason I get to do what I do best   But no matter how ya put it, the story still ends with me coming out on top, wouldn't you agree? ❞ https://twittercom/DivaThief/status/1236438392688316416 …pictwittercom/pv0NfPEUpN.
Bernie’s real victory: “The scare that Sanders put into Clinton four years ago and the organization that he built have transformed the party, moving it even further left than the questionable electoral successes of his movement justify” https://wwwnytimescom/2020/03/07/opinion/bernie-sanders-democratic-primaryamphtml ….
All his “attacks” are policy based It’s a primary People, this is absurd.
Profoundly irresponsible of you to ask people to support a corrupt DNC primary process which is an  Assault on democracy and then asking people to support it  If you have integrity and are so concerned about turn our speak out against this to the DNC.
Lol it’s called a primary You know their policies are much different right ?.

He won California which FYI was a primary.
Both candidates would need every vote they can get in the general This is maybe not a helpful distinction to consider when choosing a candidate in the primary The electability argument cuts both ways for both candidates.
Dems rigging their own primary now just seems to be a standard practice for them.
Notice neither of the primary concerns were what was in the “best interest of public safety?”  “Inside the White House, a debate centered on the concerns: How would the government’s actions be perceived by the public? And what would the president think?” https://applenews/AmAanSA7SSTSKVjOjqRDWFQ ….
Joe Biden just did an 8 minute speech at a rally (Bernie's last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour)  It's gonna be weird watching them hide him away from everyone for the rest of the primary (and during the general election if he's the nominee).
Prayers for the KHive members thirsting on Pete, they’ve clearly lost their damn minds this primary.

Good thing you told everyone that they HAVE to vote for him no matter what before the first primary vote was cast Seems like it might have been a bad idea looking back huh?.

It’s clear we have opposing opinions and therefore should agree to disagree, however we should back whichever candidate wins the primary so that we don’t have another 4 years of trump If you support Bernie, I’ll respect that.
You’re one of the few people on my timeline who can put the exact words as to how I see & feel things about this primary.
As results from primaries in other states come in, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden will each be holding simultaneous rallies in Cleveland Tuesday night, ahead of the 3/17 Ohio primary Will they cross paths at the airport?.
My Mother loved Hillary Clinton she was 94 years old when I lost her in 2010 She Voted for Hillary in the 2008 primary but Obama in the General She always told me Hillary would’ve made the better President My Mom would’ve been devastated by the 2016 thievery of Hillary.
2016 is proof that a candidate’s quality is independent of how well they poll Hillary fucking sucked, but she swept the primary  And she lost horribly in the general   Electability is not determinable by primary success.
y'all remember when Bernie was going to win the primary?  what happened there? https://twittercom/snitchery/status/1236425681560645640 ….
For several reasons, convenience being the primary one as well as control over personal messages We don’t send people to jail for that.
60p for one of those biscuits is still extortionate, we never had a tuck shop in primary school.
Completely agree I was totally out of my depth Taught primary for 2+ years unqualified too was just unaware it was still a thing?.
It’s a primary.
Yes, I typically record each candidates’ speech times on an excel sheet and before the primary I calculate an average for each and the one with the highest average gets my vote.
I will be voting for Joe this Tuesday in Michigan’s primary.

The year is 2040, all the coastal cities are underwater Ivanka Trump is running for her 5th term Democrats are still fighting about the 2016 primary as AOC narrowly defeats Conor Lamb.
I'm convinced that that's the primary reason  There are a lot of people I enjoy interacting with on here - yourself included (sorry, that sounds like a suck!) - but whilst I'm prepared to hunt through my timeline to a limited extent, I'm just not prepared to sift too diligently.
Thank you People forget there is a primary and then the general I supported @AbdulElSayed , but ultimately voted for Gov Whitmer.
If only the @SJEarthquakes primary shirt and socks were also predominantly blue.
