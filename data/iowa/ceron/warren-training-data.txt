major changes for just 1 poll  bernie bump makes sense, his most likely path includes winning the first 2 (& winning 1 helps 2)  biden doesnt need to win, but a 4th would be rough  warren looks steadier than other recent polls  but surprised this doesnt hurt buttigieg a LOT more.
You're looking at in a vaccum Context is everything They were down 24 and were getting dominated the whole game Jimmy beat warren off the dribble and it's obvious it was a frustration foul and Jimmy took exception.
Matt I don't think old Nancy wants to lock horns with warren     When she forwards the articals this week most of the slate will have to leave for the hearing Leaving Uncle Joe and some bozo on stage.
That warren moon is insane.
Barack Obama #1 Elizabeth warren #2 joe Biden #3 for president would work then the one that gets nominated would choose one from the other two to be Vice President that’s great beautiful then take back the senate and Moscow Mitch McConnell is out wow do I have a wild dream ?????.
New Year, new polling out of IOWA: @BernieSanders tops his opponents for the first time in the Des Moines Register/CNN poll Biden is in 4th place, but within the margin of @ewarren & @PeteButtigieg -->https://twittercom/DMRegister/status/1215770484429684736 ….
true, one poll is only a single data point, tho DMR has had a good history  the point about more people considering biden as a second choice than bernie or warren is probably the more important point of the poll.
it is quite simple, biden has taken the dementia patient vote while Mayo ete BootyJudge has secured the youth vote, and Liz warren has secure the female vote - devastating Bernie leaving him with just his core, white male support base.

she didn’t ‘share a platform’ with blue labour though, it was a blue labour event? alongside her clearly close links with ian warren she’s obviously sympathetic.

yeah, i think most of this stuff is dishonest but i've seen some confusion i think is genuine but like, surely it's obvious that people thought warren's policies were promising and could move more in the direction they wanted and then found out she just moved rightwards.
warren danced awkwardly yesterday while iran shot missiles at an american base, raising the risk of war she pretended to be a woman of color in order to get that sweet gig at harvard law decades ago she waffled on m4s and her poll numbers sank but sure, warren stans are smart.

a lot of talk about bernie's people bullying warren may or not be true but bernie folks are definitely the meanest on here not saying thats bad but its true.
Good luck with warren glad your prepared to give up on Medicare for all because two neo liberals say we can’t have it As for me I’m taking the most consistent guy in the race It’s been real fun.
I was questioning your push for the campaign to go negative on warren because of the negative press like this Seems like they don't even need to do the thing to get the consequences so they should probably just go for the jugular now.

do you understand how stupid it is to say 'elizabeth warren surpassed biden once before' for a two week stretch while not acknowledging bernie surpassing biden more recently and judging him based on the outcome of an election that included intraparty colluding to derail him?.
anyways i will at least say that it’s unfortunate that warren’s campaign is crumbling to dust before that chuck e cheese-ass mayor’s is i wanna see him go down first.

Some Our Revs endorsed warren so at least we maintained a tighter line than that lol.
Here’s my theory The votes are in for the endorsement and they are announcing on Friday Voting is closed They wouldn’t be tweeting this if they are endorsing warren in a couple days And if they are, it’s not a great look calling her out on this.
#Warren suggesting Trump's airstrike was effort to distract from #impeachment trial Though I question her partisan motives I think she may be onto somethinghttps://wwwnbcnewscom/politics/meet-the-press/warren-questions-iran-attack-timing-impeachment-trial-looming-n1110596 ….
