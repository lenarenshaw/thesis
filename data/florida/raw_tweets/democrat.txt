Bernie is not a communist or a socialist He is a social democrat There is a huge difference, that a small amount of research could easily clarify for you.

Have you seen the record numbers Trump is putting up in the Republican primaries? Nobody even needs to come out basically and I think he had close to 650,000 voters turn out in Michigan alone  No way Biden or any democrat takes him down.
I love watching liberal hypocrisy  You only comment on falsehoods against your heroes and so blind you allow what you deem horrific if Trump does it, but silence when Obama did worse  You are a joke, just like the white men queued up to be the democrat candidates for president.
I’m not a fan of Biden, but it is extremely obvious the democrats want him as their nomination and it’s time they got behind him to beat Trump  The same disgusting tactics killed Hillary’s campaign, if they didn’t play dirty, she could have been the president right now.

Wonder who is financing her run Why do I think she is running and will continue u m see independent to steal votes from the democrat nominee.
she's really right-wing for a democrat, she's been extremely homophobic, she's run a bunch of defense for Assad, she does an "anti-war" posture except half the time she's gone around criticizing Obama for not bombing stuff hard enough.
If Bernie goes hard the media goes crazy and says he isn't a democrat and just wants to tear the party apart from the inside It is a no win situation.
Wake up America it was because the other democrats dropped out before super Tuesday, which those votes went to biden and bernie.
I have already said in this thread that I am voting for whoever is at the top of the ticket Any democratic candidate is better than Trump, and that’s what worries me, because I have seen Sanders supporters they will stay home or protest vote if he doesn’t get the nom.

Denver Democrat faces backlash after tweeting ‘solidarity’ for spreading coronavirus at Trump rallies  https://wwwfoxnewscom/politics/denver-democrat-faces-backlash-after-tweeting-solidarity-for-spreading-coronavirus-at-trump-rallies ….
Won’t vote for Bloomberg He’s not a democrat He’s a hostile takeover.
It is astonishing to me that individuals missed school, took off work, etc Got in their car, sat in traffic, waited in line for a long time only to walk into the voting booth and select Bernie Sanders as their pick for the next democratic candidate Some people smh.
Se vince Sanders i democratici saranno costretti a rivoluzionarsi e cambiare Se vince Biden si rischia di ridurre tutto ad un “tutto VS Trump” #maratonamentana.

To all the naysayers that don’t think Bernie stands a chance to beat @realDonaldTrump he already loses to EVERY democrat running Now, throw in a tanking market and COVID19 coupled with his incompetent response and bameven Hillary who isn’t running might win.
Not Sanders If Trump wants him then Putin does too  I can live with Biden while we retake the Senate Then the democrats need a strong, known candidate for 2024.

The democrat did learn from the mistakes of the GOP establishment in 2016 and they don't want to repeat that mistake Surprised they learned it could and would happen to them if they let it.

Sorry Steve your side lost the argument of class and correctness when it elected Trump  The things he says about veterans, women, and children blow any statement a democrat may make completely away  Your party has no respect for anyone so “Go to Hell”.
Keep in mind, just as Bloomberg will be bleeding Biden of votes, Warren will be bleeding Sanders Very strong 2nd choice relationships between both  (Via @EconomistPress analysis available here https://projectseconomistcom/democratic-primaries-2020/ …)pictwittercom/sEnvhDOThW.
It's sad that none of the candidates are good enough to beat President Trump in November, so they have to create a team consisting of the democratic candidate failures in order to beat Sanders and then hope they can beat President Trump.

He is a gad damn disgrace to the Asian people 10 times worse than Andrew Yang At least Yang had the balls to stand up and tell the democrats they can't blame everything on the Trump administration, and he did not support impeachment This guy is a complete hack.

I shudder every time I think I was a democrat for forty years You are a disgrace to this country We said no to your policies so you have been trying to harm this country ever since.
Why does Trump always have a rally where there is a democrat primary????? What will he do on Super Tuesday?.

RepubliCONS only claim the constitution but they have never protected it but completely destroyed it with their democrat friends Never forget Bush gave us the PAT ACT, and Trump banned bump stocks, “just take em” he said! https://twittercom/dkahanerules/status/1233176042078179331 ….
Hey that’s great, a democrat AND a war hero Andrew Jackson! Lemme do a quick google search and see if there’s anything problematic about that guy, before i stan too hard   oh fuuuuuuck.
If Warren has a higher "percentage of supporters who will vote for the Democrat" than Bernie, that more likely means she has much less appeal to non-democratic voters It is a huge reach to think dominance has anything to do with it.

You know the gop is hemorrhaging when your Republican friend for 35 years posts   “The most racist democrat is still less racist than the least racist republican”  I am still a bit surprised.
I'm like seriously spinning here Sonia Are you really going to compare a Republican pretending to be a democrat with Bernie Sanders? Bloomberg, maybe, but the man wants what almost every non-centerist democrat wants and more.
Lol, which is it? Is he or is he not a dem? And should he be allowed to run in a democratic primary?.

Well boy I’ll tell you you’re right That’s why we shouldn’t put Sanders, a non-democrat Instead we should nominate someone who’s been a democrat their entire life and who enthusiastically supported Obama in 08 and 12 Pete did Sanders and Bloomberg didn’t.

Never going to happen volontarily More likely 3Rd way takes Dem name, already control money and narrative Fascists, white nationalists take GOP name, social democrats create a new party, under our control with clear priciples of unity and progressive agenda, no big tent BS.
The thing is it’s not really a true democratic vote when there are caucuses and open primaries where Republicans are voting for Sanders in order to sabotage the Democratic Party.

BULLSHIT! Democrats cannot be trusted remember Hurricane Katrina? 50+ yrs government funding to shore up levy, $ went into pockets corrupt democrat politicians  Hurricane hit! Dem Gov refused federal help Then your corrupt party blamed it on Bush! Democrats cannot be trusted.

Sure he is he votes with the Democrats, he caucuses withe the democrats he goes along with the democrats coups  He's a dem.
If this happens, it's clear the Democratic party is beyond corrupted and beyond reform I wont legitimize an un-democratic, plutocratic institution If they override the will of the people I will never vote Democrat for the rest of my life https://twittercom/DavidKlion/status/1233150331502108672 ….
Whoever wins the democratic primary should make their slogan “this is what democracy looks like”  This election is a battle to save our democracy and it is important to draw a line between the two campaigns what side is for the people   A government by the people for the people.
Sounds just like him! Everyone is behind Bernie, (especially if u r b/w 18-39) Remember that the democrats said: "President Trump, is scared to death of biden" THEY WERE COVERING FOR SANDERS!

I wouldn’t worry about Klobuchar She won’t be the democratic nominee for the General Election.
You've made a compelling case for elizabeth warren not being the democratic nominee and an absolutely moronic one for primarying her senate seat.
To be fair, Bernie has lower unfavorables than Biden, Bloomberg or Warren and higher favorables than anyone  His support has even gone up since this morning consult poll, but they don't have all the graphics in the more recent ones https://morningconsultcom/2020-democratic-primary/ ….
