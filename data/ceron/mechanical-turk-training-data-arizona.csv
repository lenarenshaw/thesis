#Bloomberg accuses the rest of them pushing communism AND THE CROWD GOES SILENT. pic.twitter.com/t9IForVbCt,arizona
Warren is a little over the top tonight.  #Desperate,arizona
Watching this zoo called Nevada caucus. Early voting for caucus is moronic,arizona
These Dem Debates are wild,arizona
"I invest in the future and this stock going take over, juss need Tesla mek a link wid dem",arizona
That is why we need a real Democrat not a old pipe piper who is promising every thing free ?,arizona
"@JoeBiden appeal is widespread, and he's not to be written off yet. Plus every time I ask myself ""What if Biden gets elected?"" I relax,  thinking, ""we'd probably feel safe again."" #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020",arizona
"If bloomburg wants to win he will have to become a champion of the left and that means he needs to attack trump,  this slightly humorous stuff wont win votes.   He needs to hire elizabeth warren to design attacks on trump and big oil for him.",arizona
"Stick to your principles, we have time. Don't be bullied, don't dismay, #Democrats are not the #Sheople, that's the #GOP.   Fall in Love in the primary.  Fall in Line in the general.  #BlueNoMatterWho #TakeBackTheSenate",arizona
Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed 1-2 is every golf fans worst nightmare. If Kevin Nah slides into 3rd I'm not even watching tomorrow,arizona
This is going to be a disaster for Bloomberg and the Democrats,arizona
"@amyklobuchar's statement ""I'm sorry we can't all be as perfect as you, Pete"" was REPREHENSIBLE. As a lifelong #Dem originally from Kansas, I don't think she embodied Midwest values in the least. #Shame",arizona
wait she works for Biden now? That seems like a large shift,arizona
"I agree. Warren won the debate, Bernie is sounding like an old lp record that skips over and over. Biden  was everywhere and nowhere. Pete was canned as usual. Amy felt very uncomfortable, Bloomy will toss more helicopter money.",arizona
Mike Bloomberg is a Bigger Man any day over tiny small little minded traitor trump,arizona
"I wanted Kamila Harris!!!! I will always love Biden because of Obama, but I thought Warren and Pete were fantastic! I just didn't like that they were all bickering among themselves! They need to stand strong and go after Trump like they did in the first two debates.",arizona
