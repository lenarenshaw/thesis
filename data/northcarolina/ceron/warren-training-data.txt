I'm not @ewarren is my first choice, but failing that, I'm going with Mike Bloomberg He will know how to bring it to Trump If it's Bernie, we might as well just give up now.
*of interest, and no, smear headline because saying something is "abysmal" when he exceeded polls (5% of popular vote) even with the blatant voter fraud and rigging is purely false advertisement Also biden/warren and others also fired ppl to transition to the next states Normal.
I think if you looked at monmouth polls it would show that a plurality of warren voters second choice is bernie It would also help if she dropped out and endorsed him before she loses all her support I’d rather a majority than a plurality.

Hi Teesa! Hopefully I can assist in proving some clarity here:  1)He has the most consistent record out of all candidates (other candidates, ie warren, were GOP within the past 24 years)  2)He is the most tactful candidate for the climate crisis (best for younger gens) 1/?.

I know she's electable Obama didn't endorse biden Sanders is an INDEPENDENT snake Mayor Pete got 0% black vote Bloomberg did 5 million stop and frisk Stopped 1 black young man 60 times That leaves warren.
You think warren is “selling out the base?” What planet do you live on?.
I can’t stop thinking about how sherrod brown didn’t run because biden left him no lane, and pete tacked center when he saw biden weak and the left on lock, and then the pete/warren voters (who have been sneakily around all cycle loving their “smarts”) is what this comes down to https://twittercom/AsteadWesley/status/1225902742239170560 ….
Interesting analysis I'm not radical about any pol but am definitely pro bernie & warren i cant stomach biden but hell no to buttigieg.

Only people i can comprehend are relatives forced and guilted into doing so, even like the other lgbt folk i know irl who were kinda pro pete early on shifted to warren or bernie.
Actually, I support warren primarily, and sanders has been my second choice But all the sanders supporters getting upset he wasn’t handed the nomination after Iowa is really turning me off to him But yes, as of now, I’d still vote for him over trump.

my single concession to identity politics is that i want liz warren to be our president i think she's the most qualified, but the id part is that she's a woman i want our party to heal from the bernie/hrc wounds  bernie and liz are very similar on issues, and i support both.

1/1024 of what Elizabeth warren gets pictwittercom/Za2EULdXq4.
Just to be clear, what scared Bloomberg and the billionaires wasn't Bernie, despite how well he did in 2016, it was the idea of #ElizabethWarren - with all her well-thought-out plans - getting the nominationhttps://wwwcnbccom/2019/10/14/bloomberg-signals-he-would-run-for-president-if-biden-struggles-against-warrenhtml ….
So you believe this is what is really going to happen? Based on the energy around the state, I don't I'm supporting #warren2020 not that I think she will 'win' the primary.
Imagine how a trail of tears reference for warren would play, or a kkk reference for booker The libs would lose it But smearing a socialist whose entire extended family were exterminated in the largest genocide in history by calling his supporters brown shirts? Not a headline.
toni collette’s character in knives out is also a warren supporter but she wishes that marianne williamson was still in the race.
